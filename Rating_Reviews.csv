0,5,"Its an absolute beast if u know what are the necessary steps to follow after completing the installation of your laptop...  Make sure you update all the drivers and specifically windows bios and nvidia drivers, because it enhances the performance very much , i myself have felt the same ..  Now about the previous negetive feedbacks i would like to say about the ram that yes only 6gb is the available ram to us because of the integrated graphics but its worth it for a routine user and a normal g..."
1,5,This is the best laptop in this range.I recieved late delivery due to big billion sale but the waiting was worth it. I played The Witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 in ULTRA graphics and it was running super smooth without any lag. So for gaming its a Beast no doubt. After 2 days I was getting charging issue and the charging was very slow so I contacted HP support via whatsapp and they told me to update the BIOS and after updating it was back to super fast charging and even the system was running faster...
2,5,Good product as used of now.... Everything is good and also SSD slot is given for upgradation.... Only keys of Keyboard are not looking as reliable as other basic HP laptops....it has been a month now... I will use it for three months again and will update my review.....
3,5,AWESOME LAPTOP. It supports many high spec games like gta 5. Super quality. I liked it very much
4,4,"For that price... it's exceptionally good. Played Far Cry 4 at Ultra Graphics 1080p.. was super smooth. So was GTA V, Just Cause 4. So you can do pretty decent gaming. General PC performance is good. Photoshop 2020 (June) works perfectly and also other Adobe products. Display is super cool too. So yeah, a good system overall for that price."
5,4,"RAM upgrade is must do because the useable RAM is only 6GB, Ryzen 5 3550H is a great processor however eats up 2GB RAM in system, Due to that Heavy games like GTA 5 stutter, The FPS while gaming is good however stuttering happens when games doesn‚Äôt get enough RAM, Due to which I have to spend another 3.5K to put a 2nd 8GB ram stick. Rest all Is good Display is crisp Battey is good for gaming laptop anyway to play games chargers needs to be plugged in, Although the 5400 RPM HDD is quite slow m..."

7,5,It's good gameing laptop in this price Display is good battery backup is good And I like keyboard üòÅüëå
8,4,Best laptop in this price range... Believe me if you are willing to buy this laptop don't hesitate just go Nd buy it !! Booting takes 22 sec... If you want more faster then I will recommend you to go for ssd variant... Speed of HDD is not that slow people are reviewing aboveüôÑ... Nd wait wait wait people are also saying above ram is the problem only given 6 GB so every device have some pre installed software so non of the brand will provide u 8 out of 8 gbs ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è...there is no problem with the...
9,4,"The AMD APU is a disappointment. If you guys don't know, the amd integrated graphics will reserve 2gb of your ram so you are left with 6gb instead of 8. HP has also locked their bios so we can't change vram settings either. It is what it is, I'll recommend that you should go for an Intel cpu if you can bcz amd might be cheaper but they will eat your hardware even though you are not using it at all so it's a waste of 1/4 of ram you paid for. Other than that Gtx1650 is a beast and ryzen 5 will ..."
10,4,Okay so ive been using this laptop since a few days/weeks now and i really like it 1. The display is good 2. The Laptop runs smoothly 3. Upgradable which is a big pro 4. Great sound quality 5. beautiful build 6. Games work nicely Cons 1. A little bit slow but that can be upgraded using a ram and ssd 2. I play fortnite and rocket league on it and they run smoothly but sometimes theres a frame drop which again can be solved by ssd and ram  Overall i would really say this is a great laptop
11,5,This is my 2nd laptop and ti be true i like it preety much. The booting speed is good and can be more if you install ssd in it.  Overall look wise it's awesome üëåüòç.  I played Apex legend in low graphic settings and it runs smoothly  The lappy can become a beast if you upgrade the ssd and ram ‚úåÔ∏è An additional of around 5k to 9k can be done to reach it's maximum potential. I'm happy with it üòä
12,5,"I am using it for a day what i have noticed is it gets a little hot from the bottom right but it's manageable. The screen is beautiful, backlit keyboard makes it total worth the price. I bought it for 48,875 and it delivers really good specifications and quality. Overall it's a great product if you're getting it under 50k. If not then you should wait for some Flipkart sale."
13,4,Look perfect üíï Display is nice Sound quality is superb üíï Performance :- A little bit laggy... But if you upgrade with ssd then it gives you a good performance .. 5 day genuine review
14,4,"The true potential of this thing is unleashed when it's plugged in. Don't even bother to game on this thing on battery only. Battery backup about 5 Hrs on normal uses like browsing, video streaming etc with both wifi and Bluetooth ON.  2GB out of the 8GB RAM is reserved for Vega 8 which is a real bummer. So another RAM of 8GB 2400 MHz is recommended at slot 2.  Pair it with an SSD ( ofcourse nvme recommend ) and feel the difference.  Be sure to download GeForce Experience.  Update all the dr..."
15,1,"Don't ever buy this laptop , the description says it's a gaming laptop but it can't handle games like gta 5 and goes into hibernation mode within 5 minutes of the game and out of the 8gb ram only 5.9 gb is available and performance is not that slick , hence would advise anyone looking to buy this , avoid it and spend extra and get yourself a better laptop"
16,5,"Good packaging, right on time, gorgeous design and lovely performance, best buy for beginners"
17,4,Nice product Battery mostly 4 to 5 hours But performance was very nice 4 star for late delivery otherwise product was very nice at this price Booting take normal time but its good in hdd Because sdd was fast comparable to hdd I think this is the drawback Company needs to modify ssd on this product
18,5,This review is after using this laptop for 6 months. Display:10/10 Performance:10/10 Battery:8/10 No heating issues No fan noise while normal usage Suggestions: 1.try to add extra 8 gb ram.because amd integrated graphic card uses 2gb of ram and available ram is only 6gb. 2.try to add 500gb ssd and move your os to ssd. Then you laptop enters into beast mode  Overall great laptop with amazing specs. Blindly go for it.
19,5,"This is an initial impression review. The battery life, display and design are above par. Gaming experience is terrific with a good, strong card inside. The issue might be the 2GB RAM reseved by RX Vega which is the inbuilt mobile gpu of Ryzen. All in all, a good package and a great value for money. My suggestion would be to install an ssd and an additional 8 GB RAM in the near future to get the most out of the product. Note : Disappointed by flipkart for not putting in bubble wrap in the pa..."
20,5,greate deal for the price to performance ratio. for gaming it is good but only one problem it heats up quickly so for better you should keep it on cool surface for gaming . Other things are exellent. 'I loved the experience
21,5,Product is excellent but battery is draining is lot faster than I expected but it is above average. Overall product is good and I think you also get what you paid for. I am happy with laptop.
22,1,"Sorry, after 2 months of buying now....I am thinking why I bought this laptop ....I recommend don't buy you can go with intel instead of ryzen ...I bought it for coding and designing purpose but yet I haven't installed such softwares ...still it is getting hang while watching yt on it ... just like our Android get if memory gets full ...and also some time sentence of some part getting on screen adruptly ....design and display of lappi is excellent but had performence ...."
23,4,Good product performance really awsome and powerful battery life...üòáüòáüòç.. I like it very much
24,4,It is having a wonderful build design ? Build quality is really good Bcoz of not having ssd it's not that fast in opening files apps and softwares It doesn't gets too much heat Overall satisfied with the product
25,5,"Overall this is best buy in this price range. Only issue I found that it has 5.9 gigs of Usuable ram out of 8 gigs because of integrated amd graphics. It gives approximately 40 to 60 fps in high end games like watch dogs 2, gta v, Witcher 3 at high settings. Battery is decent, display quality is good....."
26,5,It is a bit slow.... If you want faster experience install ssd in it. It has SSD slot or you can go for SSD variant.Other than this all are woking good. I think this may not be a big problem. I loved it.... The gaming experience is so nice...overall performance is good..
27,5,Good Experience with this Product. For better more smoothness and for better experience upgrade add 256 GB SSD in it .
28,4,It's small...Design good...Clarity awesome....Performance is good after 1 week use...Battery charges fast and stands nearly 6 hours for normal use ...One minor problem when it's charging we can't use the mouse touch pad smoothly...It's jumping and lagging....Better use separate mouse like i do...Just cause 3 plays very smoothly...Only 6 gb ram we can use as a default... Over all its a good one ...
29,4,"The laptop in short is a beast.For peaple owning a laptop for the first time,it would be bliss.It has many flaws(with HDD).But for those who are willing to take care of their laptop,it will work like a charm. Overall,I would say just to go for it."
30,5,"I am writing these reviews after using 3 months of using this laptop.  Points: 1. RAM capacity is 8GB. If you want to enjoy gaming, atleast install 16GB RAM. 2. I played games like AC Valhalla, GTA 5, RDR 2, Days Gone, Witcher, AC Oddesey, watch dogs 2 and many more. At the highest graphics settings you can sense some lag, but good for mid range graphics. 3.Heating Issue: Yes, this can heat up a lot, but to mention gaming laptops use graphics so that is natural. To use the most out of laptop,..."
31,4,Product is awesome I m fully satisfied with the product. Display quality is superb But the delivery experience was not so good took almost 15 days to deliver the product..
32,5,Performance was awesome .....it has Amd Rhyzen 5 3550H processor which has slightly lower base clock speed of 2.1 GHz but that works much better than Intel Core i5 9th gen and also neck to neck i5 10th gen....some said it was also better than i7 9th gen ....which I can even realise when it renders videos within minutes in DaVinci Resolve which is most renowned video editing software and heavy software in the industry...but that is only possible with an extra installation of M.2 Nvme SSD from...
33,5,"Excellent laptop for professional as well as gaming purpose. I am writing this review after 1 month of use. First when I got the product it was not the proper product as the OS was having some problem. But immediately hp service man have checked and cleared the problem. I am using this laptop for design purpose. I use to work with AutoCAD, CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, etc. These applications are running super smooth and speed in this laptop. However if you are using this kind of high end applications ..."
34,3,"One of the best budget gaming laptop loved it üòò. Smooth performance, good graphics card but it would have been better if there were other colors of RGB lights on the keyboards and u cannot change the color of the keyboard lights. But good laptop beast performance."
35,5,"I have been using this for a week now. Short answer, just go for it, the best non chinese laptop under this price segment. I brought it for 48k. I have seen most of the reviews saying performance is not great. First things first you have to plug in while you are gaming otherwise you won't be getting the peak performance or just set battery to best performance while you are not plugged in.  Boot time with HDD: Again I have seen many reviews saying it takes around 1 and half minute to boot ..."
36,5,"Actually it's good ,no problem yet .just update your windows and it will became more fast. You can also add ssd and ram if you needed. Look wise it is great and battery charges very fast due to 150 watt charger.  Actually it's perfect if you add ssd and ram"
37,4,This Laptop has a HDD which is really slow at booting...i would recommend you to buy a M.2 NVME SSD for Faster boot time and great performance...and also add up an 8GB ddr4 RAM for great performance
38,5,"Pictures don't do justice.. Product is awesome and built quality is too good. Looks premium. Upgrade to ssd for most of this beast.. Display is awesome. Backlit is good. Purple is better than >>>red, white.. I have used many of them... Battery is 4 hours.. Overall it's a beast under 50k..  If u are getting it under 55k go for it..  Out of 8 gb ram 6 gb ram is what we get.."
39,5,I ordered this laptop a month ago and I really love it So this review is for those who aren't sure if it's worth it well to be honest it has a average battery in terms of me rating it But it is really fast and the screen is really good Design wise and performance is really good It comes with a ryzen 5 processor and gtx 1650 Graphics card Which is really great Especially for gaming U can play fortnite above 60 fps and 120 fps with no problem Go for it it's really worth it The only is...
40,4,"I bought this laptop for a balance routine like moderate gaming and normal work, and i have no complaints. The battery backup is really good of around 4hrs 30min to 5 hrs. The keyboard is well lit and you have no problem seeing the buttons even in dark room conditions. Ive been using this for 3 months now and I HAVE NO ISSUES with it. Do keep in mind that this comes with the TRIAL version of Microsoft Office and not the full version. It comes with McAfee antivirus which does a really good j..."
41,4,"Ok, so I have a lot to say. First of all, I ordered this laptop for my sister on 7th Nov. My father purchased it and it was fast delivered. Coming to packaging. Flipkart terrible packaging from the outermost. When we first unboxed it the hp package was perfect in condition. The laptop was fresh as anticipated. It was perfectly sealed. Ok now coming to the product. I'll say it directly. Pros Display-15.6 perfect if you want a big screen and got bored of a 14 inch one Processor-a ryzen 5 3550h..."
42,5,"Very Good Packaging. Product safely kept. Received the product in good condition. Clean Stuff. Only problem is the RAM, 6GB is only usable out of 8GB"
43,4,"absolutely satisfied with the product. No ssd in this one but believe me it boots up in freaking 20 seconds. its just mind boggling. performance wise its descent handles my alll the tasks like a charm and it has got a good cooling system as well. fan not so loud so . if u r having a strict budget around 52k just go for this, spending little more and getting a hexa core proccesor model 1021ax would be wiser though. go for it u wont be dissapointed.  Edit: if u buy this one here after do not uo..."
44,4,Overall This Laptop Is Great But Someone Who Want Something Perfect I inform You That For Ame Lovers Its gReat thing as 4gb graphics and 8 gb ram is spectacular on the other hand battery drains quickly when you play games its important to plug in charger while playing  Screen size is small compare to others but its budget friendly so no offense  Need ssd for the fast startup and game lags due to it when power supply is not connected  I lost my battery sign on the taskbar so if anyone know how...
45,4,Best at this price range only compromising thing is its ram but 6 gb ram also handle many AAA titles with ease but you may notice some of very high end titles sttuter like GTA 5 because of ram if you upgrade your ram to 12 gb or 16 gb then you will get the real performance of this lappy ....no frame drops after upgrading and handle 70% new games with 60fps ij high setting .....
46,5,In this price range this is better lappi and you can also option for upgrade your ram and also attached ssd for better performance but one demerit was processor 3350h if HP inbuilt 4600H processor this was AWESOME deal but over all performance was good . Display 5star Battery 5 star Processor 4star But if we attached SSD then speed and performance will increase but overall in this price range i will give 5 star after 20 days use ..
47,4,The product is best at this price ... The only con is it is a little bit slow because of hdd but can be corrected with 256 gb ssd ... So that will not be a big problem... Charging is very fast and battery life in normal usage is 4hours.... Overall good laptop
48,4,"I bought this laptop 7 days back and according to my, this laptop is pretty good .let me first talk about the design, so the design of this product very good and the performance of the battery is also nice but I don't like the keyboard because of the LED light you will not able to see the letters present on the keyboard and the final one is speed. In my case, the laptop speed is a little slow. If you add SSD then it will become more fast. so then thank you for reading my review."
49,3,"The design and the user experience is best in class. But, it is quite slow. Even simple activities take longer time to respond. Also, would have been great if it had a Touch screen instead of a regular screen. Overall, I am happy except for these issues."
50,5,"Its been 2 weeks I am using the laptop, upgraded with 8 GB more RAM and it works like a charm, all the AAA titles of game runs smoothly on it - The game you name it and this beast will play it like charm, overall a great choice for official use also - For Work from home. To unlock the beast do upgrade with 8 GB ram and 240 GB SSD and it will run faster than any other laptop in this price range. Great value for money, Looks are awesome. Great choice."
51,5,pretty cool design the performance is really good the battery performance is good and it really charge very fast comparing to another laptops if you are seeing a laptop under 55k you can go for it
52,5,Amazing Laptop Loved it I upgraded the 256gb Western Digital Nvme SSD into it which make it's performance next level Booting time reduced from 40 seconds to 18 seconds. Recommended to install ssd to get real performance

54,5,"Great gaming laptop in affordable price... Must buy for gaming lovers and content creators..   Pros: 1. Display is crisp and smooth 2. Processor 3. Upgradable with SSD upto 1tb and ram upto 32 gb  Cons: 1. Stock HDD is slow and it takes pc to start upto 3-4mins.(once I upgraded with WD SSD and copied the OS from HDD to SSD by WD disk cloning app, this problem cleared and takes me to windows within 10 seconds) 2. Games like GTA V can be played only when the laptop is connected to charger. Wh..."
55,5,Laptop is good in terms of performance and gaming. Good display n processor for the price. Only con is less ram as integrated vega gfx eats 2gb so u get only 6gb. An additional 8/16gb ram can solve the problem. Rest everything is working fine.
56,4,"This is a good laptop.I played farcry 3,farcry 4 without SSD or ram upgrade.But BlueStacks lags.If you are a freefire player you can play lag free in smooth only.Charge don't last long.For gaming 10min it drops more than 20%.With charged only u get smooth fps.If u upgrade ram and SSD it may be good."

59,4,"This is a decent gaming laptop, not recommended for high end gamers. However for casual gamers it's a nice option and performance is also good."
60,4,"The System is quite good in terms of processing power. The only problem is HDD, it takes ages to load anything. Be it booting or starting any heavy app. It takes a lot of time to run apps and to boot up. The same problem is true for most laptops with HDD as primary storage.  To overcome the long wait in boot time. I use the hibernate option provided by windows instead of shutdown. Hibernate keeps all your apps running and cuts of the power to the system. So the next time you turn it on, it's ..."
61,4,"Display and design are great hdd is slow i updated this ssd its very fast and battery is average but 150watt charges charges very quick, gaming performance while charger plugged is seamless i got it for RS.49240/- perfect deal im happy with it."
62,5,Awsome laptop. Only battery backup is a little lower but charges faster and windows 10 is genuine it is still awsome laptop.
63,4,"-Laptop looks great. -Display is awesome. -Those backlits are awesome man. We feel like watching the backlits turn-on the whole day. -Battery is below average to be frank. I get hardly 2:30 hrs backup. -Speakers are good, but not the best in this price rang e and especially when they mention B & Bo audio system, I expected more from it. -As it has only HDD, it's not that fast, it gets stuck at times but still manageable. -Graphics is good. I played Asphalt 9 legends.  Verdict: Go for it!üëç"
64,4,"Review after 3 months !! If you really want a good display laptop,just go for it. screen display is awesome than asus vivobook and mi notebook. If you want a performance and speed then you really need SSD. without that it is average. Just normal gaming and takes a bit second to open apps and games. Bit SSD will make it a beast !! Overall m happy with the beast üî• no other laptop has such feature in this range. 1. Display 5/5 2. Performance 4/5 (bcoz of hdd) 3. Speaker 4/5 (it's decent) 4. L..."
65,5,It's awesome product.. it's completely fast working process and multi short cut touch and design its ultimate like this laptop . I lived it ... battery backup generally good. Once you completely charged ur working continues online 5hrs I think. As per price the product its better then other laptop.  But design its fibler related plastic.

69,5,Awesome Product. Really fast and reliable. Haven't played any games yet but it pretty solid with multi tasking. Takes some time to start up the first time but then later its fine. I preferred Ryzen 5 over intel because of performance and it truly delivers that performance.
70,4,I bought this laptop far a week now.. it was soo cool and amazing performance for this price range.The only issue is with the booting time gets more time because of no ssd.. and the battery is pretty good for my usage..and for great performance there is a M.2 sad slot you can easy add ssd and run os on that ssd it will boot fast and fast processing üî•..

71,3,"Battery is pathetic, like I was getting free electricity in Delhi due to limited consumption, but this laptop sure gonna hike my electricity usage.  Laptop lags a bit , atleast 128 GB SSD should be given , and yes ram needs to get upgraded too , in order to have good performance.  Rest okayish product. For average usage."
72,4,Nice and best product as per specification but only battery backup is needed and i will suggest tjat if you are buying this product then please insert an SSD for smooth and better experience in it.
73,4,"this laptop needs some extra ram to be installed after purchasing as it is slow in many ways and if possible have some budget after buying it to upgrade it with a ssd and ram then it is a beast. over all build quality is very good. the matte finish make it looks classy but at the same time attracts everything including dust, fingerprints so it needs some pampering. The keyboard backlit is very awesome and is eye catchy , sound is awesome, screen resolution is just best. battery is average jus..."
74,5,One of tha Best laptop for Gaming and also for office work  Pros... Best performance Best display Best Sound Best design Best battery backup Beautiful backlit keyboard Trust of HP service  Put ssd and increase ram yourself.. Then this laptop will be Beast performance.  Cons.... Average webcam Boot time max 30sec... Only 5.9gb Ram available
75,4,Overall I like the laptop and perferably perfer this one.  Pros: 1. Speaker quality is good 2. LED quality is good and great display 3. Keybord is nice 4. Battery back is nice upto 3 hours without games. 5. Laptop build quality is nice. 6. Cooling is very well. 7. Camera quality is quiet well. 8. Processor is at their best  Cons: 1. There should be an SSD in place of HDD ( In this price tag ). 2. There is lagging problem while playing games on battery mode.
76,5,"Ok, first of all this is gaming laptop, so if you are looking for gaming purpose then it's absolutely for you. Now Talking about battery performance then it's as usual like for all gaming laptops. Only thing is it doesn't come with MS office licence key. Overall laptop is worth it...üí• Have a nice day..."
77,2,"This review is after using for 1 week after installing all the updates and updating BIOS. This is a mediocre laptop. It just gets the work done. If you are purchasing this laptop, better get the SSD version or better get a SSD and upgrade RAM. The HDD version is really slow to boot up and takes 2-3 minutes after startup to function without stuttering. The initial 2-3 minutes after startup is really painful to use. My 2012 Dell laptop with HDD boots faster and can get to functioning properly ..."
78,1,I have Changed my review from 5 star to one... DUE TO BUILD QUALITY. AFTER using for 2 weeks. The build of this laptop showed its colours. Its very bad. The Hinge is quite rough to open. and it makes a tick noise. Also the ports side plastic quality making tick tick noises when touched. i checked in the service centre. They said the build quality is not promising. but laptop is functional. So poor Feel from this laptop. Look wise its good. no issues. But the feel is totally destroyed coz of...
79,4,Worth it guys go blindly for it but as its a gaming laptop battery backup is not nice but laptop design and other stuff are awesome
80,5,"Go for it , It is a budget friendly laptop with no issues.  You can upgrade in future :- 1)Ram (Upto - 32 GB,3200mhz)The information in product page is wrong. 2)SSD (NVMe)  Backlit keyboard is present at this cost only. The wifi is super fast also the bluetooth. The base speed of processor is 2.10ghz."
81,5,Best laptop for this type of specifications in this affordable price. And also good for Music quality.Display is good for quality videos . Performance is not so good.
82,5,"The only thing that I noticed is that it takes a little time to boot up. I have had used Lenovo before, beside being old it boots even taster than HP. Other than this I like all about it, when it gets little hot the two fans kicks in which makes me feel that I have a powerful machine. If you have more budget, then I would suggest you to go for Asus ROG. Which is too of the line product."
83,5,Good laptop with quite good display and features. Performance wise the processing is little slower than expected. Good buy at this price. Games run with good speed and efficiency.
84,4,This is best laptop for students. I really like keyboard and disin. Startup almost 10s. But super and amazing. Perfomance is specialy amazing. I konw ryzen is best than in intel.still i satisfied this product üòç
85,5,"This is my first higher price product that I bought from Flipkart. The seller was PETILANTE ONLINE. I was very much satisfied with overall everything. I literally have zero complaints. The package and the delivery was all perfect and genuine. Coming to the laptop, it's the BEST machine if you're looking for a great gaming and also for other miscellaneous purposes. I never thought that online shopping would be a bliss. Thank you, Flipkart."
86,1,"Pathetic performance take ages to load the PC, had already replaced it once thought performance will be better in replaced version, it worked for a month now back to the same issue, booting takes a life to load? I also bought extended support with technician visit which does not work they want us to do all sorts of check by us before a technician visit can be arranged so pathetic support system. I won't recommend HP hardware."
87,5,Very nice product must buy !!!!! *Performance is very nice.. *Battery backup up to 90min for gaming otherwise for small works 3-4hrs *Audio quality is good but not so loud. * Display also good even we can use in sunlight Over all nice product must by this.
88,4,I am writing this review almost a month After I have started using the product. As per the price it is an Ok quality of product. You can expect this quality of product for a range of 50k to 55k. I have got it on 48k inclusive of offers. Pros : 1.Got a very productive and effecient build quality. 2. Backlight Keyboard 3. Great 15.6 Inch Display. 4. Graphics card and Support 5.

89,1,"Flipkart and hp, I'm really disappointed in both you with this slow lagging machine. I have seen so many videos that told me that this machine is a very good option but even after spending 55k rupees in this dabba. I'm not even able to use Chrome on it. It's that slow. Yes, not even Chrome. HP people are you sure, you are one of the best companies. You have made this lagging box, just so i can regret trusting you again. I thought maybe 55k is enough for me to get a decent laptop for daily use..."
90,4,"Its takes a several minutes when its starting for first time. but after that it runs smoothly. Also the specification of RAM given here is 8 gb, yes its true.. but for daily(normal usage) you can use only 6 gb. Rest 2 gb is reserved. The best thing is The display and trackpad.  the thing which I didn't liked is that, it only has 2 usb ports which sometimes feels short when multiple devices needs to be connected. Pros: Best Display best nvidia graphic card ryzen 5 chipset Compact attractive b..."
91,5,Good trending budget gaming configuration. HP has hit a jackpot in this category and it‚Äôs sales have seen a huge demand for the price point... more than Omen series. Can use it for Design softwares as well as heavy Gaming... serves well for both. AMD Ryzen series of processors wont disappoint you... trust me!
92,5,The laptop is just a beast. I loved the design of the laptop the speakers and the keys are the top quality. The battery of the laptop last well for normal usage for like 6 to 7 hours. I received the latest hp pavilion model the wifi is the best and it can connect to a wifi and a ethernet cable together at the same time you can enable this feature from the omen command center you can download it for free from the microsoft store the laptop performance is also good i am using this from last 10 ...
93,3,"So I waited a LONG time to write this review. I have been using this laptop for about 10 months now and I feel that it is pretty good. It smoothly runs almost every game, and it is great for coding. I use it for literally everything, and it is a great experience. However, using this thing in the first 2 months or so was like the biggest disappointment. It was slow as hell, games did not run properly, and the boot took forever (still takes a bit of time). I contacted HP Support multiple times ..."
94,5,Highly Satisfied and value for money Laptop   7 months since I purchased this laptop and it works perfectly . Boot time was more since it has only HDD but when i installed SSD everything is just matter of seconds . Also upgraded Ram to 16 GB only I confirmed with HP service executive that the laptop Ram can be expanded to 32GB.   I suggest to confirm the Ram capacity with HP service center before upgrading the Ram
95,4,I using this laptop from three months. Autocad software are not running smooth. There are lagging problem for heavy autocad work so for autocad or 3 d software this laptop is avarage
96,3,"My initial product had to be replaced because of various issues, I believe I have recieved a product that was returned by someone else.  It was damn slow and plastic felt very cheap, like for example, when you lift the laptop, you hear cracking noise throughout.  2 laptop;  First thing I did to uninstall the trail version antivirus as that made the laptop too slow. Second, updated windows and drivers.  Performance is ok and I'm not rating good because, the load time is very high but once wha..."

98,5,If you are go for a decent laptop then I should recommended this as described there is a huge and most of the amount of power that can be delivered by a AMD ryzen 5 3500H processor can be processed and there is a huge lot of processing power and many more decent display decent power backup for 4.5 or and a decent multitasking and full HD display which can be a great pleasure for who can do Photoshop and title gamer why most of us for follow by HDD that can be slow your laptop so you can be go...
99,5,There is 1 slot available u can upgrade ur ram and boost your performance i buyed 8gb hyper ram and boom its amazing u can stay with its 8gab ram no prblm laptop is tooo good
100,3,I m giving a honest review..I m using this laptop for 1 month now..it's not that much fast as I expected..betery quality is good..when I use c++ or Java it's gives a decent experience..but sometimes it takes so much time to start..
101,5,The product is amazing it is must buy from the Flipkart if you want to buy a laptop it is very amazing and it seem as shown their and the functions is also amazing it is superb but the problem is that the battery is getting low in a very short time so this was on the problem otherwise the laptop is amazing
102,5,Nice product and the delivery person was very good and give this item in just 1 day thank you flipcart for fast delivery
103,5,"I have been using this product for both gaming, online classes and movies ...it is awesome in all...not the beast performance but still good as it is budget laptop ....sometimes it freezes for no reason for 1-2 seconds , but my overall review is that my was spent well and it has value of money"
104,3,Battery performance is very awful...only 2 hours battery backup which is very irritating you have to charge it on every 2 hours which might be very disturbing for all of us and the performance is not so great ....apps like even simple apps take 5 min of time to open which is also very irritating and PC needs different types of updates time to time and it take 5 to 10 kin of time to open. Processor is good and graphic card and when you use PC for 4 to 5 hours it heats up like a very hot cooker...
105,5,"After upgrading the ram to 16 gb... All games for this specification works fine. I played few games including pubg pc, warzone, gta v , wolfenstein young blood, gears 5 .. all of them work great in this laptop"
106,5,Excellent product super value for money I mean this is a all rounder though u get gtx 1650 ti in competition but then is jus about 5 % gap go with this upgrade ram and ssd and good to go
107,5,excellent laptop with amazing looks and good price range. Just add a SSD to it and it's super fast.
108,4,"The hp pavilion gaming ryzen 5 laptop is a great option for a mix between business and gaming laptop. It has great design,good sound, great display.good battery and processor. The only downside is it doesn't come with a SSD which is a must for this laptop. It's a little slow without the SSD but since I had the SSD installed it's very fast. All in all a good buy at this price. Add 5k for SSD 500gb"
109,4,Design of the laptop is very good . Performance not that good because some high spec games like GTA 5 are lagging . Need to install a ssd and a 8 GB ram additional. But I think this is the best laptop in this price range as it offers Nvidia gtx 1650 . And also battery backup is also just ok not good .
110,5,I just loved it ....It performed beyond my expectations...If you are planning to get a power laptop with sleek and classy design go for .... It will offer you great experience ...You will just love it..
111,3,I have been using this product for the last 10 days. So let me share my experience here.  -Its packing was great  -It has a decent screen.  -The backlight keyboard with violet color makes it quite attractive.  -speaker sound is good  -Battery backup is okay (even after using normal applications. Don't know if u play heavy games!!)  -webcam is great.  -this laptop is a bit slower & its booting time is more which makes it look like its lagging. It should be more faster as it has an AMD Ryzen 5 ...
112,2,Startup is very long  Battery is not good  Working speed also no good .  This is the worst experience in laptops I ever used .  I didn't use first 15 days due to some person reasons now till then my return period is over .  Please I strongly recommend don't buy this laptop
113,5,07/09/20 today I got my laptop and it's design is fabulous looking too good. Really lite in weight display is descent for a hdd it is little bit slow but it has a nvme m.2 port for upgrading and a ddr4 extra ram slots so you can upgrade whenever you want to.best laptop for gaming and and work.ryzen processor really works well and that purple colour combinations is really eye catching
114,5,At this prize Intel is giving best laptops. But for 50k ryzen 5 3550h quad core is less At the prize of 45k other laptop is giving ryzen 5 hexa core

116,4,"The Product is Good Not Best. There are 2 Problems here, One with Ram and One with HDD. Well Ram issue is not the big issue Here, Games are still Playable. For Those who don't Know out of 8 Gb 2.1 GB of Ram is totally occupied by The Vram of the Cpu, So u are left with 5.88 GB of Ram. Now The game still runs like GTA 5.  But The Issue comes with HDD being 5400 Rpm its less. Its Pc performance degrades. You will see windows starting little late, application taking time to open. Also GTA 5 st..."
117,4,"the laptop is great, an excellent buy for students and gamers alike.  the cpu and gpu work great in gaming and video editing. display size and quality is excellent. the keyboard feels really tactile and good to use. one of the con i found about this laptop is out of the 8gb ram, only 6 gb ram is usable ( 2gb ram is reserved for the integrated graphics). so i reccomend adding another 8gb ram stick for the best performance."
118,4,Ok So first don't trust on my english i hope you people can understand.  I review this laptop after 1 month of use i purchase this laptop on 3rd December 2020 today is 3rd jan 2021.   Look wise product is awesome. looks you want in gaming laptops this laptop satisfy the looks  Lets talk about display and the display is to awesome do not worry about display. Performance wise : you got amd ryzen 5 with radeon vega graphics(for display) and gtx 1650 dedicated graphic card with 8 gigs of ram but...
119,3,At first week the laptop was quite fast it's booting time was also less than 1 min. But after 1 month due to some windows 10 update booting tome went upto 4-5 minutes. And the laptop battery was also not too long for general purpose we can use it for 3-4 hours or sometimes even less. But I am happy with hp customer service because when my battery adapter failed to work they replaced it with new one. I could suggest you that instead of buying HDD you may buy 4gb 1050 graphic card with SSD. Whi...
120,5,"A great laptop at this price segment with hp branding. I would suggest to go for ssd variant not with hdd one it takes around 15 -20 sec to work properly at time of boot. Battry is decent you can watch videos for 6-7 hrs i guess But dont expect gaming without charging  Conclusion- nice product if you want to do all work gaming , editing, coding and video watching"
121,4,"Besides all reviews i fell good after buying this laptop. But their i feel some lag in performance. I prefer you to go for ssd version or buy 256gb or 520 gb ssd for upgrade if you want to enjoy its full performance . Regarding to battery, it is a gaming laptop so thier battery quality is always low as they are build for playing games while charging for full performance.all total battery is better than expected. All total you can go with this laptop but later you have to buy ssd and ram for ..."
122,3,The laptop itself is nice it can play most games at high graphics at 60fps i play total war troy which is a demanding game and it runs smoothly. The main problem arises when you start playing games like forza horizon 4 the game will run at 60fps ultra but due to very slow hdd and very low ram it will stutter. The laptop has 8gb of ram out of which 2.1 gb is hardware reserved for vega 8 graphics which itself is good and can handle most things on its own. After that the os will take futher 1-2 ...
123,3,"System starts very slow sometime 12 - 13 minutes. Not happy with that, and if you want to use any good software or number of process then 8GB ( in that only 5.8GB usable its a Big Note to anyone who's is buying laptop because rest of it will be used for video card as per the laptop stands) is not enough.  But don't worry you can buy DDR4 8 GB ram and install so the laptop will be real fast and that might cost another 4.5k.  Overall I don't feel it's good to buy for 51k. Rather I would go for ..."

125,5,"After a month, I'm reviewing this Pros:- 1) The build up of this laptop is literally the best amongst other gaming laptop. Attractive. 2) Better crisp display & also you can do pretty good gaming on this laptop. Like GTA 5 on HDD with 40-50 fps n minor lags. 3) Better Battery backup. Lasts 3.30-4 hrs once charged fully. 4) HP support is appreciable i.e after service 5) Value for money n best at this price.  Cons:- 1) Hard disk rpm is less like 5000 ..."
126,5,Great laptop especially fans for cooling. Add another 8 gb of ram and an SSD and then it'll skyrocket like no other. Fans do their work exceptionally well as the most important job of a gaming pc is cooling the system. Which is performed best in this price bracket.
127,3,Best Value And Discount From Flipkart.... But This Hp pavilion Ryzen 5 Gaming Laptop Not Good For Gaming Performance.... Please add some money and get better Version Of Ryzen And Graphics Cards.... Like GEOFORCE RTX
128,5,PEOPLE LISTEN.... MANY SAY IT'S SLOW AMD WASTE OF MONEY AND CREATE A RUCKUS IN THE BUYER'S MIND.... SEE... IT HAS SLOWER BOOTING TIME ONLY BECAUSE 5400 RPM HDD.... JUST CLONE THE OS TO A SSD...THATS IT... IT'S A PERFECT BEAST... AND THE HDD IS NOT AS DUMB AS PEOPLE SAY.... REMOVE MANY STARTUP PROGRAMS IN MSCONFIG AND ENABLE QUICK BOOT IN BIOS... MAXIMUM 25 SECS BOOT TIME AFTER THIS... MOSTLY 15 TO 18 SECS...... THE LAPPY IS A SEXY BEAST TO BEHOLD....

135,5,Laptop is really pretty first of all. I have played sekiro and mk 11 till now both are working on max. Only issue i am having is of ram the system gets overloaded very easily because of ram. Maybe if we just upgrade it all will be fine. Overall everything is working as expected.
136,4,Review after 2 months usage PERFORMANCE- It's bit slow because of 1TB hard disk..if it was with 512GB SSD then it was perfect beast..add SSD to laptop then it will be excellent..but no problem it's ok BATTERY-Battery is very impressive ...in battery factor it's the best laptop with more time of battery backup...battery best DESIGN-BEASTüíØ SPEAKER-best ever experienceüíØ PRICE- Value for moneyüíØ BEST IN ALL FIELDS JUST FOR SPEED ADD SSD

Although latest high end games like Devil May Cry 5 (2019) takes quite a toll on the ram often causing the game to lag if played for longer duration so my recommendation is to play latest high end games for less duration about 2 hrs not more than that. Hope upgrading it will fix this issue otherwise everyt...

I have played rise of the tomb Raider, you get around 30-40fps on high settings.

Additionally u need 8 gb ram to play high end games without laaging, sluttering and smooth. This laptop have hdd capacity boot up time..."
153,5,Very nice product in this price range.
154,1,Only purchase it if you're ready to spend at least 5-6k more on adding additional RAM and SSD. Without SSD it's dead slow. And you'll need additional RAM to play games as AMD keeps 2.1 gb RAM reserved so you get only 5.8 GB RAM available which is too low.
155,5,Great performance but there is need to add a SSD for boost in the performance.Got the order after a delay than expected delivery date but product wasn't damaged.Product was intact.Overall nice future proof product.
156,5,Beast with beauty
157,5,"This HP laptop is specifically bought for my daughter for her engineering studies as she has to make graphic designs using Solidworks, PTC Creo and Ansys. Ideal computer for Engineering students."
158,5,Guys it's an superlap at this rate but after buying this u need to add SSD card and upgrade the ram nor will will cause u super lag u will hate this so do upgrade the lap I am writing this after use of 7 months I had lag issues before upgrade after upgrated that it's super nice to play games and stream with no lag issues so don't forget to add SSD and Upgrade RAM
159,2,Performing worse than my expectaions. Even my Dell Latitude 3400 works faster and smoother than this.
160,3,1) Real daily boot time is 4 minutes atleast. Don't expect to boot in 1 minute. 2) lags a little while using from first day. Opening of apps is not that fast. 3) hdd used in it is of toshiba company. Hdd is not good its speed is slow. 4) comes with mcafee antivirus of only 1 month. 5) ADDITIONAL RAM AND SSD IS MUST in this laptop !!!
161,5,Must Buy. Excellent product. Value for money.
162,1,One of the least efficient thing I have bought from. Flipkart no doubt packaging is quite good But performance of laptop. Is mil. It's boot time is 3-4 times future We have to wait for 2-3 mins for google chrome or microsoft edge to start I think this is not gaming laptop this is waiting laptop all time just we have to. Go on waiting
163,2,"So this rating is for the laptop which comes in original condition without ssd. Before ssd laptop was performing below average and HP bloatware was dragging the performance down. So I installed a new wd ssd and migrate os in that ssd. Now the performance is improved alot. Machine boots in 7 to 10 seconds, copying speed is 22mbs/sec. And I am happy.  Laptop body is fingerprint magnet.  Recommendation- if anyone wants to buy this product install ssd in it. You will be happy."
164,5,Just wow! üòç
165,5,Perfect laptop under 55k
166,5,"Best Laptop Ever. I thought the HDD would be slow, but it's booting in 15 seconds. battery backup also fine, I'll Upgrade to SSD and 16 GB ram. it'll be The best ever."

171,5,Today i have received the laptop..Thanks for flipkart team.. and we will write review the laptop workings after 15 days
172,1,"Writing this review after 6 month of usage, after updating latest update of nvidia amd and software update boot time it quite okay performance is the worst thing in this laptop games frequently crash and hangs a lot worst experience ever."
173,5,"Don't buy the cheap words of people saying that it is a fraud of something. It is expected for radeon vega 8 to cover up 2 GBs of your ram. I've played cs go, fifa 21,etc and there wasn't much of heating issue. If you are a typical gamer, you should go for a higher laptop. I've got work of programming and modelling, and this product provides satisfaction. You could always a stick of RAM and M.2 nvme SSD for more performance any time you want."
174,5,a personal suggestion extend ram with one more 8 gb stick otherwise gta V lags alot
175,4,Over all Good.... Windows opening speed is low.. may be due to no SSD Thanks fr all trial version software development
176,4,"It's a good laptop you can play games in medium or low settings it can give you around 60 fps,but don't expect High quality gaming with High frame rate,Also if you upgrade the ram and add ssd to it you can increase its performance,the display quality and viewing angles are also good, overall it's a good laptop for its price"
177,4,"This product is good , value for money But after usage of 6 month , laptop will show some problems"
178,4,Performance is not good but after upgrading ram it's performance boosted after the upgrade the games are played very well.little bit slow but there is a solution upgrade SSD.value for money after upgrading it is the beast.fan noise is loud
179,5,Very good product and less price
180,4,It's a handy laptop for both performance and style. I have been using for a month now and I have zero issues with any of the spec or nuances around the laptop. Ryzen's quad core sure helps keep cpu usage below 50% even during hard core coding moments while I have 20+ tabs open chrome 2-3 heavy developer softwares running simultaneously and Spotify plays music. I have not played games with it so I'm not in a position to talk about the gaming aspects of the laptop.
181,5,Best laptop at this prize range..

183,4,Nice laptop.
184,5,Gaming experience is absolutely amazing...
185,4,"Good laptop, but to take full advantage of this you definitely need to upgrade both SSD to make it faster since it is very slow loading applications and even booting and upgrade RAM, coz when I play games on this laptop it stutters a lot since only 5.9gb ram is available. Other than that display, keyboard n track pad are good. I didn't find any worry some heating issues while doing intensive works which is good.

190,4,Preformance + premium looks üíØ Go for it
191,3,Good product but delay in delivery
192,4,The start up time seem to be a bit higher than usual where as the specs should be reducing the time to start. Initially I got a start up time of 20-25 sec to Login Screen .. which was really good. however it seems to be a bit slow now a days. Unsure of the reasons. Battery back is good. Display is beautiful. Very less heating issue. Gaming is good. Haven't done extensive gaming though. In-Built apps helps a lot.
193,5,"I have used this laptop for a month, the windows that installed on hard disk is very heavy hence booting time is very high, i have reinstalled the deafult windows with bootable pendrive,now its fine for use ,now it take 15 to 20 sec to boot, performance in improved after reinstallation of windows."
194,5,My first laptop purchase and it was the best. Yes off course it is slow but it is nothing that can be solved by an SSD a mere 120gb m.2 nvme can change this laptop a ultimate beast. I play Resident evil 7 and Batman Arkham Knight both perform very well in 1080p Max settings.
195,5,It's all things is good but battery backup is written there 5 hours but it not it's battery backup is is only 3 and half hours
196,3,"The laptop is slow! Really really slow. And this, without any new applications installed. Disappointing performance."
197,5,Awesome laptop

I do graphic design and rendering using Blender and it works fine I have no complains so far   Negative points: Cyberpunk lags so I had to uninstall. Problem in loading large Blender files Lag issues in using big graphic intensive software. Startup takes time, maybe buy an SSD version.  Not sure..."

208,4,Overall the laptop is good but after using it for 5 days the booting time is very slow but the games run good I would suggest you to go for extra 8gb ram and 250gb ssd.

259,5,SETISFIED IN THIS PRISE :-)
260,1,Worst product ever and i had a worst very bad experience ordering with flipkart the customer care is not helpfull . No one ever listens to the customer
261,5,best laptop for graphic designing and gaming thanks flipkart
262,4,I got this for 45.5k using card offer best in that price.add SSD 256gb 3.5k and the laptop is beast
263,5,Best laptop in this range with Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650
264,5,Working great. No lag. Quality good
265,5,You should go for nvme ssd hardware or u can upgrade this then it would be beast
266,4,Looks great n after use of some time I add my review
267,5,It was fantabulous inthis price range.The display and sound quality of this laptop is top-notch but little bit slow down which is negligible.Good battery backup and backlit keyboard.Iam happy with this.
268,4,Good For the decent Gaming And other user stuff...But cannot run highEnd Games smoothly without The Frame drops...unless You upgrade The Ram.
269,5,Awesome product
270,5,After ssd it is a beast goo for it
271,5,Mind blowing lappy.... I highly recommend just go for it....
272,5,Better to put SSD in it
273,4,"At first it didn't go well,Then I put an SSD, now it's going wellüòä"
274,4,"After 1 week of use my impression:  Perfomence: Laptop is slow compared to others devices at this range, maybe performance will be better after installation of ssd and increasing ram.  Battery: battery backup is descend. I will fully review this after a month or so.  Design: Design is really impressing.  Keyboard & trackpad: keyboard quality is good but trackpad is descend.  I will cover full review after a month or so."
275,1,"Updated review.  Motherboard and battery replaced by HP. Charging is an issue. While using the system, it won't charge. Shutdown and it charges. Bad product  HDD doesn't help. It's slow than slowest. Upgraded with SSD and it became lightning fast. Make the SSD primary drive with OS installation. HDD can be back up one."
276,5,"Good build quality Apart from HDD, everything is great. User can purchase SSD or buy SSD variant for more speed."
277,5,"It's a really great product, I would say go for it and it is also upgradable, so u can buy it if you want a lap for 4-5 years.  Till 1TB SSD can be installed And also extra 8GB ram can be installed (In total 16 GB)."
278,5,I got the 4 days ago this product is value for money buy it this is great deal and at this price this is beast laptop and plus point is Nvidia graphics card 1650 I love this product
279,1,Bought the laptop a week ago and it had already started to hang almost every time I switch it on
280,4,"Feels premium, looks premium and build quality is good"
281,5,awesome budget gaming laptop I'm so happy
282,5,It's really good. Performance is also good.
283,5,Good economical product
284,5,Worth buying
285,5,Performance üíØ Battery üíØ Overall üíØ
286,4,An awesome budget gaming laptop having a good processor but HDD makes its quite slow but all over its Excellent
287,3,"I donnow it takes 2.1 minutes to start only some times, i feel somehere d system is slow, may be bcz of No SSD, but still this shouldn't be this much slow, even opening photos, opening windows takes around 10 seconds some times even 15 seconds, and multi task also i feel not too fast, lets see after two days hw it works Even the Adobe softwares response is also satisfactory, not completely satisfied"
288,5,"Best laptop in this range Got at 46k only. Played Valorant without facing any problem Need to add SSD for rough usage, otherwise no problem in normal use with HDD."
289,5,I HAVE A PROBLEM ABOUT THIS LAPTOP NOT ABOUT THIS LAPTOP BUT ABOUT FLIPKART SERVICES FIRSTLY FLIPKART GIVES ME SURITY ABOUT I WILL GOT MY LAPTOP AT 18 OCT AND IT TAKES ONE MORE EXTRA DAY AND IT ARRIVES ON 20 OKAY THATS NOT A PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS MY LAPTOP IS ALREDY SETUPED AND WINDOWS IS ALSO INSTALLED ON IT AND ONE USER ACCOUNT IS CREATED ON IT AND SECURITY SOFTWARE IS ALSO INSTALLED ON IT AND FOR CONNECTIVETY THEY ALSO ATTACHED JBL SPEAKER AND MANY MORE AND AND I CHEACKED LAST TIME WHEN ...
290,4,"I got this laptop only in 47,000 .... I am so happy with this product (till now) Battery last long about 5-6 Hr in normal video streaming"
291,2,"Performance is average, and the gaming performance too is not so good. I tried to install gta 5 and ith lags like hell even at low settings. The battery backup is also so poor."
292,1,"Utterly disappointed It literally takes 2.50 min to boot up and another 50 sec for system to set up. Even after read all the comments about its worst performance I made up mind to buy it and hoped I can manage. Now I feel how stupid I was. I am regretting everything now. What I have done to my self!!? It is very slower than my i3 laptop with 2 gb ram. I know SSD WOULD HAVE MADE IT FASTER, BUT REALLY DUDE THIS IS AMD RYZEN 5 WITH 8GB RAM COMMON ON!!!!.what will be more worse than having 8gb ra..."
293,4,Pros: Performance is really good Excellent configuration for the given price  Cons: Poor build quality No pre-installed MS office Battery last long for max of 5hrs unlike hp is claiming like 8hrs
294,3,Worst customer care experience. Even after 6 days of my complaint HP was even unable to find what causes the problem and I am still waiting for an explanation from them.
295,5,The laptop is an absolutely power package for the given price range and runs most games at a decent pace . Gta v has encountered a frame rate lag but runs almost smooth when service priority set high and framerate at 40fps. The absence of an ssd and an higher ram is an disappointment but the upgradable slots are a counter to the issue with an additional expense of 10grand will make up for an 1tb ssd with another 8gb ram . Overall very satisfied with product
296,5,Nice to handle
297,4,This could have ssd card for faster operation and not having disc drive.
298,4,"Only 2 usb slots provided which is disappointing, battery backup is just ok sustainable not that great. Display is ok doesn't have a full HD vibe. Overall a good one."
299,3,Low battery backup upto 3.5hrs for normal usage
300,4,Laptop is overall value for money and u can play GTA V like games in very high settings. The main problem Im facing is its performance issue.but after installing SSD and Ram this laptop is working very smoothly u won‚Äôt regret after buying it. And finally the Thermals of the laptop @ max temp during GTA V was 84 degree and that is quite good so this laptop is very in thermals also u can play 4-5 hours continuously. üëç
301,4,It an good machine but one must add SSD before or after using it(without SSD it pretty much slow) SSD slot is available(M.2)
302,5,Great quality and good looking device.
303,5,Its amazing laptop with 55k budget..... Awesome experience with gaming..... Battery backup is good..
304,4,Everything is okay but sime times it got slowness as 2 GB RAM out of 8 GB RAM is already locked by system....just getting 20 to 30 seconds hanging
305,5,Best in price but must add SSD
306,5,Must buy product and amazing gaming beast at this price
307,3,Awesome product.
308,5,Nice one but require ssd
309,5,"product is so good just go for it. battery is good. display is awesome. graphics also awesome. it hangs some times , but after the windows update it is awesome. best laptop at this price"
310,3,Not bad
311,5,Perfect device in this price range
312,1,"Don't even think to play warzone with this laptop, it just hangs up and you'll be taking an year to come back to home screen."
313,5,HP IS GREAT FOR LAPTOP AND PRINTER
314,4,Totally good.. U always need charger for avoid lag and battery draining while playing gta 5 and other high games.. Also u need to add ssd. For better perfomence.. 8gb ram. But 5gb available.. Design and backlit is very good... Best value in money..
315,5,Little lagging problem otherwise everything is good üëçüèª
316,5,"Nice laptop in this range.. only one thing that the Laptop Speed is not great as per our expectations, but after update bios and Windows OS Speed increase from than previous speed...."
317,5,Better version but for better performance u need to update ssd
318,4,Everything is good but they are not giving SSD.. Almost all companies are giving SSD in this price..
319,5,"I have used this laptop for more than one month and have not faced a single issue in it..I have played gta 5, did video editing in premiere pro, coding, used Adobe Photoshop and everything was working absolutely fine.. But if you want more smooth exotics l experience you can just upgrade the ram to 16gb and this laptop will become beast.."
320,5,Amazing laptop and a pure beast at this price segment. No lag or heating issues and battery lasts easily for 4 hours on normal usage. Got it within a day and far above my expectations. Just add an m2 SSD and additional 8 GB 2400 MHz RAM and it'll be the best thing ever.
321,5,"I edited my review after the heavy use like(working on Revit Architecture software).After installing Revit I especially feel it is laggy but if you add SSD then it works fine. Takes time for opening after shut down thats why I keep my pc on sleep mode in day time and shut down only in night. I expected little more in this price range becoz if you invest 55k money in any pc and you will feel disappointed with its functionality,, it is not fair."
322,5,Beast pc ever it can handle any game buy it if you are a student or gamer but not suitable for commercial use because battery life is soooo bad about 2 hrs only booting time is 22 sec if want fast then go for ssd version best pc
323,5,Goodüî•üî•
324,5,It's adorable
325,5,Got it at 43.5k in ugadi sale Good laptop and build quality good
326,4,I had installed the SSD coz hdd is slow overall it's good
327,5,Fast delivery and design is very good. It haven't SSD so little bit slower for use. But overall good.
328,4,Overall best product. One star deducted for late delivery
329,4,"Can't call this a gaming laptop!! It sucks üò°üò°üò° can't play gta5 properly, it lags, fps drops... worst performance!!Really bad experience!"
330,5,Game will run smoothly if charger is connected üòâ
331,4,"There are only two USB ports.HP should have provided at least four USB ports.Also,cooling ports for the cpu seem to be delicate.Over all a good package.Flipcart packing and delivery top."
332,2,"The laptop review is written after a months usage 1. Windows home edition does not have ms office which is needed for any student: misleading information by Flipkart/ HP as they should specify. 2. Computer booting takes considerable time feel that I should have taken SSD rather than 1 TB HDD, seems a bit slow in response (maybe due to Ryzen 5 processors when compared to i5) 3. Very heavy weighing laptop 4. Scroll pad does not have separate buttons below so again left and right clicks are hav..."
333,5,Good packing‚ù§Ô∏è Best customer service‚ù§Ô∏è Budget laptop
334,1,"Never seen a laptop slower than this. Forget gaming, you can't even browse internet on it properly."
335,5,"Best Laptop, I got it for 48897 Good graphic performance feels a bit slower because of AMD Ryzen 5 3550H and no ssd alongwith. display is good battery backup is good sound quality is average It is a light weight laptop around 1.8 kgs looks very stunning"
336,4,Display good Performance is some Butter It is suitable for only students Not for gamers . But keyboard backlight I'm impresse I am Getting windows licence problem
337,4,"This is a value for money laptop. I bought it for video editing and boy it does the job so nicely. And I think it's targeted for that exact group, because I think for really high end game it will run short especially with only 6 GB allocated memory. It does take bit long to reboot and you won't find any high performance in normal day to day tasks. But in high end tasks like video editing it comes to life and takes 10% time of what it used to be in my older laptop. I got it at 49k, I think it'..."
338,3,After one year the system becomes very slow. Initial starting take 3 minutes. Opening and closing application too slow. Low performing laptop
339,3,"Please don't buy this product, performance is very bad. Start and shut down is taking too much time.We will go mad."
340,1,Worst laptop ever it started lgaing from day one and can't run basic games very slow and worst performance you expect from a gaming laptop. My money is wasted and now I can't return it. I am stuck with it . Please dont the mistake I did.
341,5,"I was sceptical before buying, but I received a brand new stock, Jan 2021 in February itself. The packing itself was untouched from factory. We bought two, and I asked my daughter about the performance, she gave everything 5 stars and for battery 4 stars. Overall we are happy about the purchase after using it for over a month."
342,4,I am using this laptop for 5 months now. It is incredibly good have also give me 140+FPS during gaming. I mostly plays Valorant and it really runs well. But sometime it performs slow whenever i open up any IDE for coading. I am a CS Student and i like to code a lot but sometimes it lags during debugging and compilation of the code. Maybe its because of SSD. I will edit my Review after I install a ssd in it. Maybe after a month or two.
343,5,Beast Product Tested FALL GUYS - 61-75 FPS ON HIGH SETTINGS MINECRAFT - 50-61 FPS ON FANCY SETTINGS NO LAG GTX 1650 IS BEAST RYZEN 5 3550H IS ALSO GOOD
344,5,Good Laptop for gaming and software coding  Pros Backlight keyboard 6Gb graphic card amd + Nvidia 2 ram slot 1 used and 1 in free Amd Ryzen gaming chip  Cons No ssd so we can add ssd also Only 6 gb ram When installing heavy game cpu get 100% so laptop get hanged
345,4,Performance is good and look is awesome but sometimes the hing is producing sound in turbo mood
346,5,Just awsoom Looks 10/10 Performance best Sound awesome Just love with pavilion
347,5,Product was good and there is no doubt about Flipkart. I am very happy with this product.
348,4,"4 star is only for in this price they can add a 120gb ssd. Because of hdd machine is lagging to much, response time is high. Others all good."
349,4,The only problem is ram. I was only provided with 6gb of ram and there is no option in bios to free the ram. Else every thing is good.
350,4,Good if you extend ram and ssd
351,4,Except battery all features are good.
352,5,With extra 512 gb SSD and 8gb ram this laptop is beast under 50k
353,5,I love it just an amazing ....‚ù§Ô∏èüí´
354,4,Best laptop for gaming after upgrading 16 gb ram Because very lag in gta 5
355,5,Perfect Laptop for gaming! must bye
356,5,"The laptop was super awesome, but just one little problem, there is no screw to install SSD, they must need to provide screws for SSD. I collected one from old laptop, but had to use sandpaper to reduce the screw length. And also added a washer to hold it in place"
357,4,Really Satisfied ‚ò∫Ô∏è
358,4,Add ssd worth 3-5 k and it's beast at this price range Btw adding ssd do not violate the hp warranty
359,5,"Awesome product, amazing speed n performanceü§©üëå"
360,5,Very gud product
361,5,Nice but login slow
362,5,Good working
363,4,"Gaming performance is great but other than gaming, it's slow because it doesn't come equipped with SSD. If you can extend your budget go for SSD variant directly or you can just buy this one and install it later."
364,4,Performance isn't consistent . I think this may be due to processor or the updates for windows 10. Definitely needs SSD minimum 256gb coz the laptop feels incomplete without it . For consistency on performance and reduce the application load time or boot time. The way things are right now it's walking needs SSD to run.
365,5,This laptop can be bought only when you can afford another 10K on SSD and RAM upgrade. Otherwise don't go for it.
366,3,The Laptop is Very Slow(Installed Photoshop & coral) .. Need to add SSD in it...
367,5,Very good.but but bag not provide so liitle unhappy.if possible.please sent bag
368,5,Best one
369,4,"Nice performance, almost good"
370,4,U should definitely purchase this laptop as its a budget one... It does hav many features but i got the issue of booting time and slow opening of apps..... After that update it to your latest version and the laptop will work smoothly
371,3,Bought it for 50999/- Laggy performance. Takes forever to boot. You'll not be able to use it to it's full potential until you install SSD in it. It's better to buy 512SSD varient of this or any other Laptop.
372,4,"Everything is good but probably the worst HDD installed. You cannot game even when you get a perfect FPS because it takes time to load and retrieve the data from your hard disk. But for this price, if in case you have installed an SSD which costs around 5k for 500GB M.2 nVme then you can game or do something productive with no issues.  So an extra 5k is required unless you do not want to hard gaming on this.  The plus in this laptop is even when you game a lot with sufficient space and venti..."
373,1,Worst product from HP don't buy this one very very slow
374,3,"Major draw back is booting time takes little bit long ,and sometimes touch pad wouldn't work properly"
375,5,"Used it over an year.. Still running awesome. I am able to play games like Horizon Zero Dawn, Cyberpunk in high quality without any lags. Will recommend to add 8 gb ram more as it has 1 empty ram slot"
376,5,"Writing a review after 1 week usage. I am a surgeon by profession, needed a laptop for presentations, paper writing, some video editing. Design is terrific, gives a classy, techy look...especially the built quality, finish and backlit keyboard. This product is absolutely rocking performance wise... Intially it was lagging a bit then I updated the drivers. It started firing then, It's a complete setup for academic n educational purposes. If more needed I'll upgrade the ram n ssd..."
377,5,Best for 3D work
378,2,Never buy this laptop with hdd it's slow like tortoise
379,5,"Very good laptop. At first it's very slow, but you should add ram and ssd and then it's very fast. I added ram and ssd and now the booting time is around 10 secs. Very good laptop after upgrade."
380,5,Overall good performance
381,1,Forget about gaming.. not even good for normal office use.....Very very very very very slow... Waste of money ..
382,5,Absolutely love this laptop!!!!
383,2,Lap is too slow ... performance is too poor
384,5,Take more time to booting bcz of low rpm than normal HDD Only 5.9GB Ram is usable Sound is Good Good performance
385,4,It's a budget laptop. It has fullfilled all my requirements from playing fifa 20 to coding and installation of appium.
386,1,Bad
387,4,After purchasing the laptop it's speed was slow. Due to high graphics you will get 6 gb ram. And don't even think of playing high quality games without upgrading your laptop. But after 15 days of purchase... I bought a 8 gb ram and 256 gb ssd... After upgrading my laptop became very fast.... So u must spend additional 8k rupees for upgradation !!!
388,1,"very slow, buy ssd or don't buy at all"
389,5,"Value for money... After few setups and updates, it's working very smoothly. Battery backup is also good. Camera is also good . Sound system is quite satisfying."
390,4,Laptop is very good.. looking good.. design good...but it lags sometime...and it is slower than expected üò£üòî..So if You want a beast performance then upgrade it's ram and SSD... Battery is average...and this is my dream laptop..and now I have this dream ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
391,3,"The laptop is so good for doing ur daily works or multitasking and all. The only problem is i can't play games in this it starts to lag and there is a big fps drop. I don't know why it is happening. If anyone could please give me a proper ans, how to repair this problem i would be really greatful."
392,4,"Good laptop, But little bit slow. Looks like using an old gen computer.( I think this is making it slow ""New tech on old hardware type hddüòÖ)So I'll upgrade it lateron . All are saying that will make the performance much faster. I'll update the review afterwards"
393,2,This laptop is vary slow please go for ssd version
394,3,It is good but my delivery boy was very rude
395,5,This product is too good.... Must putchase it.
396,1,"it working very slow , we have to add ssd to working properly, without ssd it is useless"
397,5,Best laptop for College students
398,4,Best laptop for students
399,4,Best laptop in th 50000
400,5,"Superb amazing product, 100% worthy. I bought it for 50000. But remember to buy an ssd. Battery life is up to 3 to 4 hr."
401,5,Can see little lag in the game but it will be any laptop. So its not a major problem because it has Hdd in it if you install ssd in it will be faster and their will be no lag
402,3,"It takes around 30 seconds to boot, takes time to open any application so overall response time is somewhat more than expected. It doesn't feel today's generation laptop while using."
403,5,Overall laptop is very good but will need add a ssd to it and remember to update your graphic card drivers

405,5,"This is the best laptop I've ever bought in my life till now. The only lack I feel is that they didn't provide MS office full version for permanent. They've a trial version of very short duration. Now even needs to buy the software separately, I feel the extra expense."
406,3,IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY THEN GO FOR SSD MODEL OF THIS LAPTOP. THE HDD IS VERY SLOW AND SOMETIMES IT'S PERFORMANCE CRASHES. YOU CAN SEE LAGS AND THE BOOT TIME IS SLOW. RAM IS NOT SUFFICIENT AS PER THE GAMING LAPTOP. 2GB RAM IS RESERVED ALREADY FOR AMD RADEON GRAPHICS. WHEN YOU SEE THE TASK MANAGER THEN YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT ONLY AROUND 3GB OF RAM IS USABLE. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AAA GAMES LIKE GTA5 AND FARCRY THEN DON'T EXPECT IT TO RUN WITHOUT ANY LAGS AND SHUTTERING. OVERALL THE LOOK AND DISP...
407,1,Very poor performance... takes almost an hour to start That too after restarting after 4-5 times Very slow  Worst laptop ever experienced
408,5,"After one month of Laptop , i felt it is value for money. Only one trouble is that booting time is little longer. If we add a PCIe NVMe card this problem should get resolved"
409,5,"Best in its class. Ram & SSD upgrade is a must other than that no issues, battery üîã is fine ."

416,4,Need to upgrade SSD for smooth but performance with hdd is good for low end users
417,4,Great product . But if possible get yourself a SSD and 8gigs of extra RAM then you will enjoy it at its full capacity. HDD is too slow. And other than that it felt value for money.
418,4,All features are very good ..but battery backup only problem ..less time working

420,5,Just wow
421,5,In price approx 50000 the product is very good and performance is also good.

This thing bothers me that you touching your laptop and feel heat. Otherwise all other things are good.  Heating isn't a small issue which you can ignore.

481,5,It is best laptop for gaming
482,5,Every thing is fine but slightly slow due to without ssd and extra ram
483,4,"After 1 week of usage. Should have gone for SSD is the only drawback. There's another slot for expansion, which is a good option. No lag issues and maximum boot time is between 2 - 3 seconds which is good for HDD these days. Ryzen 5 is just out of the box. Battery life is also good. We can manually enable 4K with AMD settings on the system."
484,3,Not for value for money
485,2,I think it is refreshing
486,2,"Sent a defective laptop after placing an order it took just 4 days to deliver the product but when I applied for returns its been 8 days still the product is with me, the procedure to return anything is pathetic product is good only need to install an ssd for better percormance"
487,5,"Great Machine, Got it for 52k on sale and it is worth every penny, played Doom, Doom Eternal, GTA V, Just Cause and other great titles without even a single lag. go for it without a second thought :)"
488,5,Excellent Performance with this affordable price
489,4,U have to add SSD for better performance. When i switched it on performance was not good as i expected. Bought 250 GB Kingston additional SSD. Now it's good.
490,1,Extremely Slow and poor performance! The specifications look impressive only on paper but the falsely hyped Laptop is extremely disappointing. It takes over 4 minutes to boot and several seconds to open applications. The battery life is around 1.5 hours so you have to rely on constant power to continue working. HP support is not impressive because the customer service team isn't technically qualified to resolve common issues. Would strongly advise against buying HP laptops.
491,5,Fantasticüòç
492,4,It's nice product
493,5,Please provide atleast 128 gb SSD for fast boot .One of the best laptop and gorgeous look.

517,5,One of the best laptop in this price segment(around 52k). Display is awesome. Just install any 256/512GB nvme SSD and it's performance would change drastically! Overall AMD Ryzen 5 3550H is a good processor for casual gamers.

528,5,You definitely need a SSD card if you buy this laptop. It has 2.1GHZ processor. If you buy this laptop for gaming than go for 3.1GHZ processor in this category or install a SSD card. Otherwise it will work Slow. Just that processor is slow otherwise it's good laptop to buy.
529,2,I am Android developer running Android studio taking lot of ram also sound problem if I run my emulator making sound not run properly waste of money don't buy it

539,5,"The only major issue is battery backup ,which can be seen in all the gaming laptops . But once you connect it to a charger then you will get the real beast out of it . Considering the price, the laptop delivers great performance and quality of the product is very good. Total graphical memory is 5 gb ( 4gb From Nvidia+1 gb from RAM ). I'll recommend you all to upgrade your pc with an ssd of 250gb and a ram of atleast 4gb"

I dont know it only happens to me or others too..

The battery life is very low and the 8 GB ram, we provided by 5.8 GB on which we used and the other 2.2 GB is locked for hardware.

For some weird reason the usable ram i get is only 5.88 gb out of 8gb. Opted for the return option,but weirdly flipkart has only replace option,that too with only the same product. My friend just bought the same product,he is facing the same issue! Update:- received the replacement unit, still a shitbox,slow af,i guess the whole lot is defective"
611,1,The main reason for giving just one star is nothing but their amd on board gpu which reserves 2gb of the total ram in the system which seriously affect the gaming performance. Overheating is another issue.
612,1,performance too much slow. don't buy this product .it's waste of money
613,1,The product is not good with 6 gb ram but if you add another 8 gb of ram and 256 gb of ssd then it is a beast.

618,1,I had buy this laptop just some days before. And I'm very much regretted. The battery takes too long time to charge like 3% takes 30 minutes. And the laptop is very very slow and taking too much time to start. And if you play any game it lags very much or even in between game the laptop gets lock. Very disappointed.
619,1,"This device is not as I expected. Too much lagging when turned on from the first use. It say, this is a gaming laptop, games are lagging when I played some small games as well. I won't recommend this to anyone."
620,1,"screen bleeding issue noted, i return"
621,4,Due to the hdd... it's boot time and app opening time is slow but overall it's ok for a budget gamer.... The design is awesome as a gamming laptop but the top flex is visible. Built of the top is slightly disappointing. But the overall the built quality is ok. The huge disappointing thing in this laptop is that the usable ram is only 5.4GB out of 8 gb I'm very disappointed for that.
622,2,"I wanted to write this review because there are couple of things not worth.  1 Design is awesome. 2 Sound is awesome. 3 Display is awesome. 4 Performance disappointed me, I bought the laptop two days back and it‚Äôs hanging many times.

Buy only if you don't have any problems in your life
628,1,Please don't purchase it because after finding lots of diificulties when I talked to the HP customer care they told me that windows is not provided by them may be flipkart has given windows 10 means hp has provided with simple docs nothing.  Actually I purchased this laptop after reading all the review but what I observed it a very slow battery is ok only and screen gets freezes I think about 50 times with in only 20days and boot up issue. Takes about 1 to 2 minutes to start the laptop after...

641,1,Just to sell the ssd they make made this hdd thing a joke.. If u r willing to spend about 10 K more then only buy this one otherwise find something else. The boot up time and the performance it gives is jst unacceptable. Even opening Google Chrome takes ages
642,3,Man this is one of the best but of your gaming in this laptop. 8 gb ram is not enough you have to upgrade to 16 gb ram or directly buy same laptop with 16 gb ram and the most value for money in this laptop is graphics card
643,1,"Don't waste your money on this ,I am writing this review after 1month of usage, it crashes almost every time ,can,t even watch YouTube on chrom properly , always crashesh, I buy this laptop for gaming and video editing, now I am regretting ü•≤,PLZZ don't buy this"
644,1,It is worst phase and you can say experience of online shopping there is nothing which justify its cost and specifications.This is also a old model so u can buy some new arrivals of any company with great experience.
645,1,Always if you open any program it will show not responding not responding
646,3,"bootup time is around 2 min, horribly slow system"
647,3,If you are really into gaming and want to buy a high performance laptop do not buy it. Never ever go for Ryzen. I won't suggest you ever. I am writing this honest review after using it for a month. Do not buy it.
648,1,Disgusting service from Flipkart and HP.....they stuck my money......third class product they sell
649,2,"A gaming laptop, which cannot survive browser tabs more than 5, while simple apps are running in the background (Spotify, Trello, Telegram)."
650,1,Very slow laptop not working fast
651,1,Boot time around 2mints every time and profomnce not good
652,1,Laptop is getting slow while charging... started after onemonth of purchasing... not getting any help from hp after compalining multiple times... hp is reallyy worse for me
653,1,Battery is week.
654,5,Its very slow boot up time is aprrox 2 minutes also i takes 20 30 seconds to open any application btw good for gaming but very slow
655,1,Too slow performance
656,2,Please not buy this üôèüèªin 5days it have lots of issues worest battery slow boot time
657,3,Little slow it's giving me reminder of first generation pc black and white once
658,2,Booting Takes Much time (more than 5 min). Speaker sounds are very low. system performance is low.  Display is good. Battery Backup is okk as of now since the use is less and gaming is not done. Could have included SSD Hard disk.
659,4,Good working
660,2,Not really satisfied with the product and the entire process till possession of it. Laptop takes forever to boot up. The response time is very slow. I don't know if you can run games smoothly takes forever to open Chrome.
661,1,heating issue lagging takes forever to load windows 50k wasted
662,2,I was using this laptop since September 2020 it hang a lot
663,5,"Excellent laptop go for it Screen 5/5 Bettery 4:5/5 ,performance 5/5"
664,4,Avarage
665,4,Very good
666,4,"Some softwares seems to be pixelated. Also, I could notice some lag during the file transfer. Multi tasking is not at most good for 8gb ram. It still has to be more efficient."
667,5,"used very well no issue reported as of now, little bit slow due to HDD."
668,5,Very good product..
669,5,Good
670,4,Battery is not God
671,3,Performance is slow
672,3,Best on this price range
673,4,If u r going for gaming then u should upgrade SSD and Ram then it becomes beast.
674,5,Best for Multitasking and multiprocessing
675,5,Better than expected....üî•‚ù§ awesome product
676,4,"Slow booting up with hdd,, but overall good in price segment..."
677,4,Worth the money
678,5,"This laptop is literally amazing. But, a bit slow cause of hdd.. I'm certain it'll get much faster after adding an ssd."
679,4,The laptop takes very long to boot up...every app that I open takes very long to start..I don't know what the problem is...sometimes the laptop just freezes.....and while playing fifa 18 I noticed some frame drops which should not have been....because the GTX 1650 is a great processor....I tried to consult with the hp support ...but they said it's not the laptop defect....it's windows defect
680,1,This laptop is broken down within a month
681,2,"Laptop functions quite slow, starting from power ON. Even same with browsing. I observe buffer. Takes lot time to open application and switch between them.. Not upto the mark. Facing issues while using office tools. Not worth the investment of 55K."
682,5,"i like this laptop ,used outocad and heavy game smoothly"
683,1,I received a defective piece which is not getting on. Display is completely defective. I received this item as gift and hence took 20 days to unwrap. Now Flipkart says you only have the option to contact HP helpdesk. Really purchasing expensive items online for Gifts is risky because 7 day return policy gets overs till the time gift is unwrapped
684,5,"Writing review after using it for 5 months approx. It is best in market got at 49998 only. Used matlab and ansys software it has no lag. Played games like resident evil 6 , gta 5, mafia 3 . It is running game at 1080p at 40-60 fps. No issue of lag or heating is there. After playing for half an hour fan are starting to run but they are giving very cold air so no issue of beat. Temperature of graphic card maximum goes to 55 degree during games. Battery is .out 12 hrs on simple use and 6 hours o..."
685,4,Everything is good except an SSD would make a lot of difference in performance...and secondly the processor is little slower than intel i5 8th or 9th gen. But it is good compared to other gaming laptops in battery backup.
686,1,Too slow.. I used only 1weak.. The Performance is very slow..
687,5,Very good laptop must buy....it is very good for engineering students and fulfilling all requirements which we want for design purpose in this price..
688,1,Very bad to use on multiprocessing.
689,4,This laptop is very good But you have to upgrade the ram and ssd After upgrading it will become beast
690,5,"Excellent for the price but the ram we get is about 6gb, which is enough for day to day tasks but not for gaming... upgrading the ram is a must. HDD is a bit slow but if you want that snapiness in windows you can add an SSD. battery life is ok-ish of about 4 hrs"
691,3,Bro the speed is really very slow like its hangs for like 30sec after i close a game and booting time is 1min 10secs .... If anyone can fix this please let me know coz i had put all my 3 year savings on this laptop
692,3,Battery backup not so good. Games very slow
693,5,I happy with hp laptop and flipkart service. Thank you flipkart
694,4,it takes too much time to boot .it takes around 1;30 minutes

700,1,The delivery boy was a bit rude ...Design display and battery is good...but it seems a bit slow after updating the drivers it's ok ..booting time is 40-60 sec ..maybe due to less ram(6gb and 2gb Vega graphics) and HDD..after upgrading ram and adding ssd ...This will be a beast... everything else seems good..no heating problem..so if u think about this laptop this is ok and after upgrading with about 6-8k it will give best performance...like if you want any updates ....  After 10 days of u...
701,1,Laptop dead on arrival
702,5,Without ssd it's very much slow buy yah it's performance worth
703,1,"It is very slow due to low Ram, even GTA 5 doesn't work."
704,2,The product advertises that it can be upgraded upto 1TB SSD but it cannot and HP confirmed that. The laptop is also very slow. I was not at all happy with it. It‚Äôs supposed to be a gaming laptop but if it‚Äôs so slow how can one play!!! This false advertisement on the sellers part is unforgivable.
705,3,Go for ssd varient It lacks even in bluestacks
706,2,After 6 month of User It‚Äôs really slow Takes lot of time to start
707,3,"I'm writing this after using it for 3 months.  Considering the configuration it has, the laptop is extremely slow. It takes nearly 3 mins just to switch on. App loading is very slow. While playing game as well, game stutters (FIFA 19). So, performance wise, not at all good.  Looks is great. Keyboard backlight looks attractive, however you can't keep backlight on all the time as it consumes reasonable battery as well. If you keep the backlight off, since the keyboard letters are written in pu..."
708,5,There is only 5.9 gb usable ram in this laptop...
709,4,Battery backup is very low and performance is ok ok.! You can invest 5-10k more and go gor some better option.!
710,5,Very nice product..Perfect for Heavy gaming if you upgrade ram to 16gb..but its also nice to play with 8gb ram..only negative is booting time
711,1,Take so much time for booting... Too slow
712,5,Everything is great. Butiful Experience. But there is one problem HD varient is slow If you want faster experience Go for SSD varient
713,1,Machine is too slow. I think the performance issue is related to hdd and windows 10. Need to wait long time for machine to become responsive else it will show 100% disk usage. Users cant change the bios settings as its locked.
714,1,Worst laptop and worst service by Flipkart
715,4,I bought the laptop for more than 3 months now if you are a gamer go for an upgrade of ssd which will make your overall performance good The speakers are stunning compare to other laptops the b&o audio took it to the next level Display is epic with the streaming 4k video which is cool 8gb ram only 6 gb usable because of the consumption of integrated graphics card While gaming with hdd face lag issues for nfs payback bit after a bit its okay After a month i face a little bit of crashing issue...
716,3,Battry backup is very poor ... And please do not order this product ...without ssd it has very slow processor...
717,1,This laptop is i am using but this is really working are slowly...i am not happy
718,1,Worst product..
719,1,I use this laptop 1 months its performance are soo bad lak problem software very slow working and so many problems
720,1,Physical memory installed is 8.0 GB but out of it only 5.88GB is usable. They have no explanation about this. They haven't mentioned this in their specifications. Think before you buy.
721,1,Too much from the date of purchase..
722,1,hard disk speed is too slow always shows 100% disk usage and games are lagging like hell.
723,5,The Laptop if you can get it around 48 with the SBI or HDFC cards offer then it's a really great deal. The HDDs a bit slow but that's nothing an SSD won't fix and an additional 8 gigs of Ram would make any other entry level gaming laptop run for its money. Bottomline with another 7k investment this will beat anything else below 60-65k
724,1,Laptop generates lot of heat while using it Lags a lot while playing Gta5 Laptop takes 3minutes to boot up It takes 20-30 seconds to respond for a click when there is no background app running. Performance is much less than an average laptop which is half the cost of this laptop. HP shouldn't call this a gaming laptop at all and the price is way too higher for the poor value delivered.
725,1,Hangs alot. Poor performance. Worst battery. Discharged within every 3 hour. Very poor experience. Even copying a single folder of 10 GB from one drive to another take about 1 hour time
726,5,Simply superb üòçüòä
727,1,Worst product Very slow
728,2,Be ready to spend atleast 5k extra on this laptop for ssd .Out of the box this is a very poorly performing laptop the reason is the HDD. Definitely need a SSD. After getting ssd now I could run the games with discord open before I could not . Now I could alt+ tab within sec before it would crash. If possible upgrade ram to 8Gb 3300Mhz then this lap is a beast at the prize
729,1,"Very waste product i ever seened before.no customer care support.very very slow .. after 11 days the laptop showing very bad performance.the hp customer cares are not contacting me. After i submit a complaint.very very bad prduct.the flipkart , They do not givinge replacement also.don't by this product."
730,2,Laptop is a beast but very poor battery don't expect for a long time gaming should use while charging battery drains within 1hr for gaming and 2hrs of normal usage
731,1,Very very slow performance üòè. Processor very slow I'm not satisfied
732,5,Best in all way....
733,5,Good product
734,5,best laptop
735,3,It is laptop with good spec but the one and only thing you have to do is to upgrade ur m2. Nmve ssd to have a good performance and bettee booting time. And with this lap we can play games in a 60p frame per second but it takes some more time to open because of the hdd in the lap. Battery backup is good as it can last over 3.5 hrs min and 5 hrs of maximum timing.and the backlit keyboard is the feature that i found very much useful and also looks great in night time. Overall its a performance g...
736,2,The laptop is very slow and it gives only 20-30 fps on gta v 720p resolution
737,4,Best laptop@48465/- i just fall in love with this beast one!!!!!!!
738,5,"Wonderful gaming laptop,upgrade the ram to 16gb but it supports until 32gb , ssd then this absolute stunning machine, coding wise this doesnt lag even a little bit. gaming still havent tested yet but the nvidia graphics card 1650 is really awesome , 4k videos run cool"
739,5,Best gaming laptop in this range..... As everyone said u need a ram and ssd for best performance
740,5,Best hp laptop under this range
741,4,if add the additional SSD in this spec then will be seen a good performance
742,5,Good product
743,3,"I hate booting speed, it takes eternity to boot, and remember its not bcz of rpm and hdd bt something else, maybe some software issue or something. I tried to upgrade bios and update it, bt the problem won't buzz I don't know if its gonna get solved or not bt pls don't take it if u think its goof speed booting laptop"
744,5,"Nice laptop , smooth performance, worth the price !"
745,5,Too good
746,5,Value for money üí∞
747,5,"Worth the money. SSD only gives 15-20 fps, without that itself its a beast, but some few lags in some point."
748,3,Nic laptop But it's booting time and performance is slow
749,5,"Using for 3 days now.... So far so good. In a budgeted gaming laptop, I guess it is one of the best you will acquire if you go for it."
750,5,Performance beast ... But needed a better battery capacity...
751,5,Nice but not that much
752,4,Laptop is very good but the hard disk variant is slow but once you installed a ssd in it you will the beast performance.

762,5,"What a powerful and sturdy laptop. Build quality is very impressive. I bought the 8gb version. Can upgrade to 16gb with another slot that supports 8gb ram. Ssd can also be installed. Performance wise it's ok, as I use it for editing purposes, takes time to render even JPEGs. But I think once upgraded to its full power and windows, softwares shifted to SSD, then it will be a real solid beast. As of now am loving it very much and it's a value for money buy. One thing that I found odd is the key..."
763,5,God
764,1,It was very slow by starting and slow performance.
765,4,Nice product but i feel like without ssd the performance is not satisfying.
766,5,excellent
767,5,This is a budget gaming beast
768,3,Worst Laptop
769,5,Complete value for money product Very much satisfactory performance
770,1,"Received already used and defect product ,applied for return but it's mentioned more than 15 days for replacement"
771,3,"The Laptop is good but since there is no SSD, the bootup time takes much more than the expected time (Approx 4-5 Mins). The company is also not providing the MS Office lifetime access (which we have to pay separately). Sometimes even the responding time is also slow. Sometimes the type c port is not working properly for transferring files and for charging. There is no global warranty for this product."
772,2,The product wasn't expected..and also support not at all in time.
773,5,Very good....
774,4,"The laptop was superb. But its bppting is not too fast ot takes about 30-1 min. 3-4 days aftet buying there was a problem that i cant open setting, taskbar, windows etc. So i rebooyed it. But now its working excellent"
775,5,Best Product
776,1,It's the worst gaming computer ever don't buy it.
777,4,Everything is ok but it take time to open sometime good value of your money
778,1,This is the worst laptop that anyone can buy for gaming after a year the system us super slow... majority time there is a huge FPS drop while to play games.... it can not take heavy application into work time.... dont buy this Laptop u will be wasting ur money
779,2,Very poor quality performance...not worth it
780,4,"I have been using this for over 4 month now. It has geniunly stood up for my needs Been doing some coding and cad drawing using solidworks  Works just fine with this graphic card.. Rendering speed is good but 1) u will need a ssd asap At this point takes around 3 minutes to start and lags for some seconds too. 2) this does not include office 3) has macafee antivirus for only 21 days  Other than that coders, designers, students. If you are on a budget go for this one. Best of luck"
781,1,Please don't buy???
782,5,Good for normal editing and gamingüéÆ
783,4,Ssd is the real need and 8gb ram if possible
784,4,Good
785,5,Love this product. My first laptop.
786,5,Honest Review  Just one thing  Add one more 8GB ram stick and bammm. U r good to go. Every single game runs at 60fps on high setting. Even RDR 2. Best laptop. Doesn't feel need of 4600h. This is enuf.
787,5,Great design with better performance
788,4,Everything is good but disappointed by flipkart delivery  I was told it would be delivered by 11 am but delivered at 4 pm
789,1,Very slow laptop. Dont go on configurations...the new laptop OS is very very slow. Pathetic. With time it became more slow
790,5,"Very good laptop for gaming, runs gta 5, fifa 19 , COD and many games smoothly, for games like cyberpunk upgrade the RAM. Upgrade RAM and get an SSD and this is a BEAST."
791,4,Aavarage system running slow
792,5,If you are buying this product then buy a ram card and ssd with it it'll become beast after upgrading.
793,5,Very Well Featured Laptop
794,1,One of the worst experiences ever it's been almost over a year Very slow boot time Lag experience for gaming as well as general use It takes so much time just to open a folder

797,5,The delivery was fast and packing was good.
798,3,Laptop is nice but the delivery of ekart is not good they damaged my laptop by applying hook on box which is very bad thing
799,5,Amazing product start very fast without sad there is a slot for sad that you can upgrade. Design is awesome most of this violet purple you will love it. Go fot it.
800,4,Laptop is okay . But some times it become unresponsive when I use premier pro. 2gb Ram is acquired by the CPU for iGPU. But it's value for money if you can pls upgrade ram and make partitions in HDD. It's perfect but some time it lag away.
801,4,The laptop was nice and all things are good and worth.but there is issues because of HDD lagging issues. But there is a slot for SSD also. While i set the SSD it was a good experience and no more lagging. So while you buy the laptop you should add ssd in it.
802,5,good
803,5,"This laptop beast needs to be evolved. For 50k price, design, finish, core, display and graphics are great. All it needs is a 512gb m2 nvme ssd with another 8 gigs ram. One of my best buys in flipkart so far."
804,4,Prosser is poor but value for money üí∞
805,1,"The windows 10 got corrupted, so i had to spend a ransome amount of money to install a new one, plus the sound system is not working, plus the camera wont open, totally disappointed."

813,4,"Reviewing after 10 months Yeah comparing wd the price the laptop is a beast. No battery problems yet, No heating or lag issues...yeah but for increasing gaming experience you definitely need to change some power options which u can easily get on YouTube. I've also made some changes in amd control panel which boots performance. What I liked the most is it's cooling system. Talking about issues...yeah sometime I get this weird lowy bell sound coming up in sleep mode or idle mode...i seriously ..."

823,4,"The product is good.. But as highlighted by many other reviewers, laptop is slow because of HDD. Add an additional ssd for operating system and the laptop will work fine."
824,5,Phisically it looks much better than pic awesome mid weight laptop
825,5,Nice laptop
826,5,This laptop is best in this budget and also this lags a lot but we can fix it by upgrading SSD

830,5,"Good laptop at this price range. It does not hv a professional look though, build quality is good. Battery back up is ok."
831,5,Nice laptop. Performance is very good. But only problem is the loading speed. I know it ls slow because of hdd. But it's slower than average laptop boot. For the 1st boot it took around 25 mins. Then 2nd boot took around 2 minutes. Then it takes 20 to 25 seconds for booting. Screen is quite good and design is too awesome. It looks amazing. Other reviews says its battery backup is not good. But u need to know that battery is too good. I get around 6 hrs backup with 70% brightness and backlit k...
832,5,This laptop is gaming but you have do firstly upgrade it by ssd And it's battry backup is 2.5 hours at normal use it will be become less at time of gaming

836,5,Good but more laggy and display ausome everything ausome but it laggs more
837,5,Product is very good. But when I opened for the first time it took almost a hour to open. But overall it's best value for money product.
838,4,A very good laptop for the price. Totally worth it I am totally satisfied with the laptop. I have tried multiple games and had very little issue as I always run them on full graphic. Use medium settings for higher specifications games and keep graphic drivers updated all time for best performance. I only have one issue that is of battery life. It has very low battery life of around 3-4 hrs. All in all best laptop for gaming and heavy software
839,5,"Best product Supeb , exllentwork,very fast"
840,4,"Such a nice laptop in this price range! But I'm feeling little bit slow, while booting up pc and while updating windows os! But otherwise it's super cool and working like a monster. No lag in games! Mainly I purchased this laptop for my development works!"

911,2,"This is the worst product i ever used , performance wise it is very slow . If I compare its speed, it is the same as a mini notebook or the same as a normal laptop. If i talk about its speed it takes 30-40 sec to open an excel file. I am very disappointed with its performance . As a gaming laptop it has to respond on just a click.

912,1,"Most pathetic, horrible laptop. It lags a lot. A chrome book is better than this. It takes 10 seconds to open firefox browser. When it comes to games...it lags like an old computer. Don't believe that this laptop is for budget gaming by going through the specs. It's a waste of money."
913,5,Amezing product

923,1,Very bad performance and it will open 2-3 minutes
924,3,System is not upto expectation.. very bad experience . Task manager is even not responding some time.. waste of money
925,4,The laptop is great but the battery is very bad but since it's a gaming laptop battery isn't expected to be good.It is a bit slow though and crashes a lot

930,1,HDD is damn slow.. after a month the system is not booting up. Please don't purchase this laptop
931,1,Poor quality camera... slow performance... Not at all value for money.. Requested for replacement... Lets see..
932,4,Actually I read a lot of reviews here and it said it's too slow... Believe me it's not that slow ...You will feel its slow only if you have used a ssd variant before .. Just go for it.. And update your bios and drivers and you are good to go.. I just took off a star for delivery it was a bit slow it took 14 days to deliver the product
933,3,Okay okay not very good
934,4,Good prodect
935,5,It is so nice.... I love this laptop.. It is running very smoothly... For programmers it is the best laptop.... It is also good for light gaming no lack issues show in this laptop.... Nice product... ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
936,2,Laptop is very slow and it stucked
937,2,Battery backup is low . Performance is poor.
938,5,Throw in a nvme m.2 and you are good to go. Either purchase the modal with ssd or install one. Otherwise don't buy it.
939,5,It's a cool laptop it is especially good for online classes and gaming üëå if you are a student or want to become a gaming YouTube then you should buy this it's pretty cool üòé

955,5,Gerat at this price range.but you have to upgrade it to enjoy this beastüî•üî•üî•
956,3,Heating and lag issue...
957,1,"Not a good laptop, built quality is low, very slow"
958,4,Nice good laptop
959,5,Hdd is littel slow but you upgrade ssd then this laptop is beast in performance
960,5,Good laptop for casual work and gaming
961,5,Once it will taking lot of time for booting but it's assume look and quality when we will upgrade ram and ssd it will become a beast laptop happy to buying beautiful laptop. When I received small bending in touch pad but it working so I didn't replaced for very small bend it works nice
962,5,It's the beast go for it
963,4,This product is great in the price range of 49K. I would suggest to upgrade ssd and ram after purchase as it will turn this into a more powerfull machine. The only shortfall I found was the fact that bios locks the advanced settings area which limits ram of this lap to 6 or 5.8 gb and wastes the potential of 2 gb in igpu which is not needed as it has a dedicated gpu as well
964,1,I got a hang issue from the beginning. Now its 3 month's and it's still the same
965,5,beast laptop at this price
966,5,Definitely add a SSD to it... Otherwise the lap is too slow to boot up and run... Its a plus to add up to 1tb ssd upon the inbuilt HDD.
967,3,This laptop is very good but other 0battery is very bad for me only one hour play game I am suggest a pc for gaming but this is good
968,5,good
969,1,Its not working properly

971,3,"Everything was okay except the performance is slow due to HDD, better to go for SDD version"
972,5,Good products
973,5,u can use it for normal use gaming and much better battery and backlit keyboard is best
974,4,Can anyone explain what is this small white light for?
975,4,3 day used. I purchased this product only for normal purpose and Adobe Photoshop. This is good for me
976,3,Battery is is week and speed is also slow recommend ssd drive
977,5,Very good product value for money
978,3,There is a slowness because of th hard disk which can be fixed by installing a SSD. There is 5.98/8gb is only usable as the processor is apu. But it's not a problem for gaming without streaming. Edit:Gaming is too horrible with the default ram we should upgrade it to get good performance
979,5,I am totally impressed with this product Worth for Money Under 50k best gaming laptop
980,5,Beat product in mid-range. Beast of mid-range. If your budget is 50000 i prefer you to buy this laptop. It's a beast.
981,4,Overall pretty good gaming experience but poor battery
982,5,Genuinely good product after 1 week of use. Using mainly for programming will start gaming and review later. So far good laptop. I love this gadget.
983,1,Dnt buy very slow while using cad software
984,1,Works very slow manytimes real reviews after 3 months
985,4,It is good... Boot tym is slow... But it could be solved by increasing the ram....
986,5,Good Product
987,5,Looks premium but gets oil marks everywhere. Ssd is a must if you want fast loading speed. Upgrade ram also if you do multitasking of heavy apps. Ram frequency 1600mhz
988,4,Very very good.... I am completely satified
989,5,I bought this for mobile game development and coding and unteal engine and other apps work smoothly on this . Also gta v runs perfectly. No need to add ssd but yes ram can be upgraded to 16 gb to even more enhance the laptop but without it also it works fantastic.
990,3,I can play free fire with lag
991,5,Awesome product
992,1,Waste of money
993,3,Decent product
994,5,That is amazing performance...
995,5,Excellent
996,3,U can fell the lag and don't even dare to install BlueStacks.It'll hang
997,4,Everything is perfect according to the price but it definitely needs a ssd upgrade Rest all is excellent
998,4,Beast
999,5,All rights but boot is very slow
1000,5,It was really a nice product
1001,2,Some game like frozen 4 is not run nice till now bad is that the 8gb Ram is mentioned but 2gb is already use By system we get only 5.88gb Ram usable gaming experience is not good not bad also some game run smoothly but some are not
1002,1,Booting time is to long very slow performance and not worth it
1003,3,Not satisfied with the performance speed...
1004,5,Very nice product . Delivery before time . Satisfying ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.
1005,4,Entry level laptop
1006,4,Nice one. Increase ram for better productivity. That's it. People say go for SSD. But it isn't compulsory. HDD works fine as well.
1007,4,Best in value for money...as it's HDD so performance is quite slow
1008,5,Good performance...
1009,5,It is best under prize range
1010,5,Excellent product delivered only with in 2 days
1011,5,"I would say this laptop is value for money, a great machine from HP. Since there is no SSD pre installed, I would say, it would be great if the user installs an SSD after purchasing this device. I have installed an SSD onto the machine and now most of the games I'm getting more FPS and more enjoyable."
1012,1,Charging port loose connection & very slow performance
1013,5,Super laptop bro ...

1018,5,Nyc product
1019,5,Battery is not right vrey fast discharge
1020,3,Dont expect too much
1021,3,While running editing softwares for coding or some other big softwares...it slows down coz of the 6gb ram(+2gb internal graphics)...ram upgrade and ssd upgrade can help sort this issue....otherwise 5 out 5 on value for money.
1022,4,Superb quality
1023,4,Gud product and value for money
1024,3,If thay have added even a 128Gb SSD means it's an amazing deal..
1025,1,"Without SSD and 8 GB memory the system is unusable.  Having put 256 GB SSD and 8 GB more memory, the system performance is very good.  Not sure why they have not made it default configuration."
1026,4,"Laptop is good for mid-level gaming and official purpose. Design is classy, suitable for both gaming and office.  Recommended: upgrade to 500gb ssd and 8gb ddr4 ram for ultra performance."

The plastic hp uses in front side of laptop is very pure,you can easily press it and if you give some little pressure on it it can be borke. you can't think that it's a laptop's plastic. Many toys have better plastic than it. It is not a long lasting laptop as the outer surface is weak. Easily fingertips shows anywhere of laptop. Touchpad is also not out of mark.  2.

1203,5,Product is good.. Satisfied
1204,2,5.58 gb ram only usable pls avoid to buy this laptop Its booting time is not fast it take too much time Design was awsome.but its has only design...
1205,4,Everything seems to be perfect except at this price range we deserve ssd and slightly better build quality . Overall nice experience.
1206,5,This laptop is very good but if u need gaming faster then you need to attach a ssd around 140GB or 240Gb.
1207,4,All good but processing low because HDD. So i recommend buy with SSD
1208,5,Super good
1209,4,Everything is good but it takes long time to boot.
1210,4,Battery is a average factor 3/5... But overall price and features 4/5.
1211,3,Battery not good...only works 3 hrs
1212,4,At this price its worth buying without a second thought.
1213,4,Good
1214,3,Battery in high performance is only 30 to 50 minute
1215,5,Best Product Truly
1216,4,"Good product for basic level gaming, designing, autocad, photo shop and it comes with good price"
1217,3,Don't buy ryzen take intel
1218,5,Just amazing
1219,5,The best
1220,4,"Best laptop for this price range, Best display. Performance is great, it has extra slot for ram and ssd. The only drawback is that hp locked the bios due to this the vega graphics reserves 2 gb ram so only 6 gb ram is usable because of this games like GTA V, Shadow of the tomb raider, RDR 2 stutters (playable but annoying). Upgrading the Ram to 16 gb fix this issues and makes this a bang for the buck."
1221,4,Nice
1222,3,Battery backup is very worst
1223,3,"Average one , battery drain is too fast, much lags we will face even while normal use also."
1224,5,"The laptop is great overall and the GTX1650ti can run most modern AAA games, display is awesome and performance is good... BUT A RAM AND SSD UPGRADE IS MUST... And battery life is somewhat short but that's expected from a gaming laptop.  Get at least a RAM upgrade (if u don't mind longer booting and loading times) and this beast is ready to go"
1225,5,In this price range You can get this as a best deal... the battery backup could be better... otherwise product is best üî•
1226,5,The heating is more and gaming are lagaing But good
1227,5,Received the product within 03 days of placing order. Performance is great considering the price point. AMD does a great job and is comparable to i5 9th gen. Overall recommended.
1228,4,If you are a gaming person than ram upgradation is must. Build quality is upto the mark in this price range .
1229,5,Very nice products
1230,1,"I had an issue as there was a stuck pixel on my laptop and even though it's a manufacturing defect, hp does not want to help me. I'm also under warranty."
1231,5,Only upgrade to ssd and it will be a rocket
1232,4,Great gaming laptop in this price range. You can easily play most modern games on High settings and get around 45-60 fps.  One thing that they don't tell you us that 2gb RAM is reserved for the integrated graphics so you only have around 5.9 gb RAM available which can cause issues with latest games. So I would suggest getting an extra 8gb RAM if you want to smoothly play all the latest titles.
1233,4,It is a great budget buy as it has capacity to upgrade Like extra ram slot (which you require soon as ryzen blocks 2 gb by default) and m0.2 slot for SSD so ample opportunity to upgrade value for money
1234,5,Excellent product
1235,2,Microsoft office home & Student not installed in this laptop.Buy seperately cost 8000 Rs.
1236,4,Great
1237,1,Vesy slow performance unexpected from HP

1239,3,Lagging not satisfied with the product
1240,3,This laptop hangs. Like seriously after this much of processors and RAMs. Should have gone for SSD one thats beast.
1241,1,It claims 8gb ram but only 6gb is usable. The processor gets very slow eventually.. Not good for gaming
1242,1,Third class laptop no refund

1244,5,ALL ARE GOOD. - Only things what I am Missing... Is SSD - Awesome laptop with very good performance - Got this @46 in Diwali Sale..
1245,5,Great performance and looking too good
1246,5,"Best laptop in this price range . If you are playing games casually then this must be your choice. Initially the games will get lag but if u add 8 GB ram upgrade the laptop works smoothly any games at 16 GB ram. So ram upgrade is must. I play PUBG PC, GTA 5, Valorant , Warzone,Apex Legends,Fortnite,CS Go, Watchdogs 2,RDR 2etc.... You can play any high specs game only with a ram upgrade. Battery is the only problem with this lap but while u r playing games just plug in the charger and play you..."

1254,2,After 2months use... Trust me guys the system is too slow and my old pc with 2 gb ram was faster... Tried calling the customer support many times and no resolution the laptop is still slow. Normal things take time like even if I want to open browser or my computer it srsly takes atleast 45-50secs which is slow for a 8gb ram laptop and imagine playing games or using heavy softwares. Battery hardly holds for 2hrs drains like anything and even when I fully charge the laptop and it's turned off ...

1261,5,Very good product. Delivery was very fast
1262,1,Its a average laptop to buy at this price point. Everything is average except for the ram it uses. I don't know why but out of the 8gbram is only 5gb is useable. This seriously slows down the laptop. Can't change the settings through bios because it is locked by HP  Do check the physical condition of the laptop. The first one i got had a problem with the F6 key.it came out of the keyboard.
1263,1,Received defective product. Flipkart replaced it. After replacing again received defective product. Didn't expect this from flipkart or hp. Worst experience ever.
1264,3,Laptop isn't that great until it has an ssd in it because without ssd it's just frustrating to use this lap Otherwise for gaming it's a beast and for multitasking too Go for this one if u have a budget below 50k
1265,5,"On battery the display is good.. otherwise without battery the light is low. Gaming is smooth with 12Gb ram and 16Gb ram for COD warzone, GTA V, Assassin creed series including Odyssey, Apex Legends, Horizon zero dawn etc"
1266,1,Worst... product....super slow...don't waste money
1267,5,Very nice model with good performance
1268,4,"Such an awesome laptop ,beast in performance"
1269,2,"The laptop is very slow..Taking too much time to open any app. Also take approx 4-5 sec to refresh..my 14 yrs old pc having ram 2 gb , dual core processor is much faster than this laptop.. .Infact i didnt get refund option..Flipkart did fraud with me."
1270,4,Ok
1271,5,It's pretty decent laptop. The only problem is it doesn't support hardware virtualization. It means you won't be able to use virtual box or VMware. Just think before you purchase
1272,1,"On Flipkart page it was written 0% intrest EMI from Kotak Bank. But both cheated as Bank started charging intrest. And on complaining to both, no solution was done. They just tossed the ball in other party's area to resolve the problem. Atlast I made prepayment of that emi to save the intrest amount"
1273,5,Excellent

1283,4,Battery backup is not so good but all other features are just amazing üî•
1284,4,"If you upgrade it with an extra 8gb ram supported with SSD, then there shouldn't be any complaint about its performance. Yes, sometimes the mouse cursor gets stuck somewhere, but that is only for a second and not frequently. It handles most of the new generation or AAA games pretty much efficiently. Overall, I'm really satisfied. But you need to upgrade it with SSD and another 8gb of ram."
1285,3,"Gud laptop in this price range! Gave 3star becouse HD version is so slow, go for an SSD version or add an SSD to it."
1286,2,"Not very satisfying performance, I got a damaged products for the first time and the replacement process in one word ""Degaster"". Finally after more then 50 call I got the replacement after 18 days. So simply avoid the product."
1287,4,Not gud for this price better to go with ssd
1288,2,The laptop is very slow probably due to so many adm drivers. Look is very cool but very low grade performance.

If you'll install an ssd , and upgrade the ram, it will increase the performance."
1308,3,This is best laptop at this budget ...but compare to pavillion ryzen 5 vs aspire 7 i think aspire 7 is best and given best perfomance level if the budget is same go for aspire 7 or if you need to buy this laptop You should insert ssd on it...

1324,1,"This laptop is very slow , it takes 1/2 mins to open any program and load any software, it is the slowest of all other.. I'm fed up of this. I just bought this 2 weeks ago.. üò†üò† waste of money !! This is very slow, unable to work, it doesn't open any software or programs."

1326,5,Loved it
1327,3,Good
1328,4,"Very satisfied. Speakers are good, Backlit keyboard can be turned on, off or dimmed based on user requirenment. Best laptop in this price segment. If you are confused between this and MSI GF63, buy this one! In msi you will encounter heating issues and excessive fan noise but not in this one. One important thing DO NOT OPEN IT YOURSELF IT WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY. Lastly just go for it!"

1336,5,"Very impressed by the product. But if anyone is thinking to buy this, then I request him to buy the SSD one not the HDD one."
1337,3,"It's an okayish laptop. But u won't find any other laptops offering the specs which this lap is offering in the price range. It takes approx 30-90- sec to start and all the apps open very slow. Moreover, only 5.88 GB ram can be used out of the 8GB as 2GB ram is reserved for igpu this makes the games to lag a bit and they cant be run in max settings. I am personally a bit disappointed but I can't blame HP as they have tried to give a gaming lap in the extreme budget range. But the best remedy ..."

1346,5,"I got this laptop at Rs 49,000 at the time of big billion sale. The look is excellent. Surely, the screen is incomparable with other laptops at this rate. I have played Asphalt 9 in this laptop, the experience was fantastic due to its graphics card. The screen really, has wide angle view. There is absolutely no problem with hinges. Built up quality is excellent. Speaker is awesome (5 stars). Laptop heats very little during gamming. Finally, I am happy to purchased this laptop."
1347,5,They say it's Gaming Laptop but to actually play games on it with a decent FPS (60-70) you have upgrade ram as well as install SSD!
1348,5,"its a awesome laptop, only draw back is the battery, but that too is that bad, it does'nt heat up or anything, but if you play high graphical powered games like GTA 5, WATCHDOGS, etc, it last about only an hour in battery settings high performance. it does'nt lag or shuts down randomly. if you are looking for a reliable laptop with good graphics and high performance gaming. perfect laptop for you."
1349,5,Nice laptop I recommend to buy

1368,3,The product is good you can play Valorant at 150-200 fps in medium settings and play many other games I haven't tried GTA 5 yet as it takes a hell lot of time to download The only reason I gave it a 3 star rating is because of the exchange reason. They told they will give me 11k discount but when they came they told a reason which isn't mentioned in the check list but still they told us to pay 7k more so I could only get discount for 4k Everything was good the laptop was fast it had good spec...

1371,5,"Seems to working fine for now, and I've been using it for over a month. The display is just mesmerizing.  Even though you expect the gaming laptop to have good speed, you can't just pile up tasks on it and expect it to run smooth.  Also, a lot of people are complaining about the battery, which is absolutely ridiculous. The high grade cpu and GPU obviously take more energy than your regular potato pc. Also, if you run a heavy app, the laptop is bound to lose energy quickly.  Overall, a good pu..."

1373,4,"A really good laptop in this price range.  Design is simple and doesn't look very aggressive like other gaming laptops.The complete body is made of plastic but is well built considering the price.  There is lag for almost 5 min when turned on after that functions smoothly.CAD softwares like AutoCAD,3dsmax and photoshop works fine.

1374,4,Great laptop for coding and gaming I tried visual studio and valorant on it and it works perfectly fine. Battery backup is also satisfactory
1375,5,Nice Product
1376,5,Highly recommended one. Excellent performance. The system is so fast . And more importantly nice and handy to use.
1377,1,"I wouldn't recommend you this laptop. I started facing small problems like really slow performance and hang. Now, it's been only a few days and it won't even start. It's not going past the welcome screen. I tried everything but it's stuck at welcome. The laptop asked for an update and it all started from there. I installed just one game and played it less than 1 hr. I am really upset and angry"
1378,3,"It does say it's a gaming laptop but most of the high level games do not run smoothly, and it gets hanged frequently while gaming. Not the best laptop for gaming."
1379,2,Not bad
1380,4,"Overall Good and value for money. I brought this 49k. But if u are doing some heavy task like heavy coding then the ram is not sufficient for you, you need to upgrade it."

1388,2,"Bit slower,battery backup very bad i am using it..in every 20 mins it goes down by 10 percent.. Don't go for it"
1389,1,worst product...very slow... don't buy HDD version
1390,5,Very nice product with super performance. Meeting the specs and expectations. Good gaming laptop with strong performance
1391,5,Its a beast at this price. Go for it. I played GTA 5 and it ran smoothly but obviously not on ultra high graphics. It's good for everything mainly gaming. But you should upgrade your ram to 16gb for maximum performance.
1392,1,Worst battery. Not charging properly its not being a week.
1393,4,Battery is below average.... Without buying separate ssd don't consider this laptop..else its good one..‚úåÔ∏è
1394,4,This is best budget laptop for student and gamers Aslo good for official work. Pro. 1.Average battery is 4-5 hours. 2.Overall performance is best in this budget. 3.graphis is good üòé  Cons. 1.ms office is not provide these is bad move from hp.

1396,4,Good so far
1397,5,nice

1399,5,It's a beast..
1400,5,Excellent Laptop for Gamer and 3D Software and run Smoothly. I got 49000 in big billion day
1401,4,Giving review after usage of nearly 20 days. The laptop is working smoothly with its good gaming performance... The battery performance is good...for normal usage it goes around 4.5hrs Internet surfing approx 3.5 hrs And if u want to do heavy gaming than u need to put it charger......the battery drains very fast...... And the display is also very good Sound is also very very good... I bought this is Bigbillion day @48750 So close your eyes and buy it Very good laptop in this range....
1402,5,It is massive but has a less battery
1403,4,As per performance it's really awesome. But HP support team just bogus. Firstly they try to avoid the problem and manipulate the issue. Secondly maximum support staaf has list technical knowledge. They even not know minimum specifications of your laptop. Just horrible.
1404,1,Slow processer neither good for gameing nor for graphics designing
1405,4,Nice laptop
1406,1,We are continue getting trouble in sound and after complaint still nit solved
1407,5,Amazing üòç
1408,5,"The most perfect laptop in this price segment. I was a bit confused when i heard everyone saying that its slow. But after buying it I can surely say that its the best , no slow working nothing, booting takes 17 sec and many high spec games can be run like PUBG,GTA 5 AND MANYMORE..!! IF U R WILLING TO GET A LAPTOP FOR 50K THEN JUST GO FOR IT..!!‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫"
1409,1,system hangs on normal usage. forget about games. just chrome with 6-7 tabs. ram was said 8 gb but ur task manager shows max as 5.9G. I think it is taken for some other processing. note over this 2.6G taken by windows with no apps open. so u will be left with meager 2 gb for all ur application. very bad decision going with rysen and windows 10. also this is not ssd but I was expecting little faster boot time. my old i3 lap with win 7 starts faster. bad decision choosing the product
1410,4,Display and Performance is awesome but battery sucks
1411,1,It's new product Still it's lagging much
1412,4,"It has battery issues, otherwise great performance!"
1413,5,If you are only taking for regular task like meetings and projects on ms office than go for it . It's the best  If you are taking for gaming then go with this   But u can't do everything on it..  It's not fast  Boot up in 35 seconds..
1414,5,its best i have issue with lotz of heating while gaming
1415,1,my concern is on battery backup.it last only for 3 hour on an average.....never buy ..it is tooo much hanging
1416,1,The hard disk of the laptop was damaged within 7 days..... Really upset with such kind of product... Flipcart customer support is also not responding to the issues..such kind of response was not expected by flipcart

1424,4,"It is quiet slow in running apps like IDE,Chrome"
1425,5,excellent for gaming. but there is bug which locks your pc within few minutes of playing game. simply go to hp site and update your bios. problem resolved 100%
1426,5,Amazing
1427,1,The Processer is not working properly Processer is slow
1428,5,It is the best product for this price...
1429,5,"Product is too good. I bought it in Dussehra sale in 45 k. Worth every penny. Its been two weeks and I did not find any problems in it. Boot time is 12-15 sec. Battery backup is 4 hrs max in mix use i.e browsing, movie playing and working on files. Plastic used is good and design is awesome."
1430,4,Good product
1431,5,looks better in hand for performance improvement update bios and other drivers
1432,4,This is very good laptop performance is great everything is smooth. But if you might feel a bit slow booting when you restart but if you install ssd then it's great and it will be beast ? So if you planning to buy then go ahead ??
1433,5,Its overall very good but when I'm playing pubg in Hd extreme its sometimes hangüò¢ Otherwise gaming experience is superb.
1434,5,"Best laptop for budget laptop gamers, battery life , display and performance is very smooth and games like gta 5 can be played easily"
1435,5,Best laptop under 50k
1436,3,"Value for money, It is upgradeable to 32GB of DDR4 RAM. However HP should have provided screws to fasten M.2 SSD Drive. Got it for 46k"
1437,5,Verry good performance
1438,5,Nice one and ultimate music effect With B and O technology But for faster experience use ssd
1439,4,Loved the laptop.Just update your windows and booting time will reduce to 25-30sec.Add SSD for better performance.Delivery was slow.Overall a beast .Add SSD and ram for more awesomeness
1440,5,I have used this laptop for 1 week and now I am writing this review. I liked the performance of this laptop very much. Though it comes with HDD of 1TB at 5400 Rpm its gives 55-60 FPS in GTA 5 on very high settings...
1441,4,SSD is compulsory for good performance without it performance is bit slow and after adding 8 gb ram extra your laptop is complete.  Everything is good. Display quantity at its high performance.

1452,5,"One of the best laptop in this price segment . I am happy of this product amazing performance , display quality is very good ha sharp detail.. i have brought this laptop BIG BILLION DAYS in 47000Rs. You should buy it weight 1.8kg very light weight compare to other brand gaming laptop"
1453,3,If you are going to buy this laptop so go for ssd variant or buy this and upgrade ssd otherwise laptop is very slow and add 1 8gb ram stick for overall good performance

1455,1,Could be better. For solid works it's lagging. I don't know if it can support GTA 5 with ultra graphics. Audio is very disappointing..

1466,5,"Got this for 49990, it's a beast at it's price only drawback is it's design as built quality is not upto mark so you've to be very sensitive using it and hinge is very fragile. Spend 6-7k more to make this laptop perform like a beast get an SSD (500gb preferably) and 8gb RAM which i got at 2249 and then just notice it's performance in pretty much impressed by it's performance."
1467,1,Very slow in beginning days

1471,5,Good for students and daily usages. Can do gaming in free time and watch movies. Best for all things.
1472,1,Very slow. Horrible batter backup.
1473,2,Not perfect...for gaming and graphic design...booting time is so high..
1474,1,Battery gets drained pretty quick you charge it to 100% and play for 2 hrs and that's it. Well coming to display you will be able to see screen bleed towards edges the processor is good for the price paid and overall you can play almost heavy games better if you add SSD to improve overall performance just battery and display is only concern rest all is pretty good for the price.
1475,4,Overall good product
1476,5,It is the Best laptop at this price range.The sound is better than the other laptops at this price range and one advantage is that the speakers are above the keyboard thus the sound is very good and clear and no sound is lost if you keep it above bed or any other surface....another thing is the the display is also good without any screen or keyboard bleeding.I have tested various games and believe me almost every game gives 45 - 50+ fps in ultra setting and if you play in high or medium setti...

When i bought this i didnt knoiw much about HDD and SSD, if i had known, i wouldn't have bought this. After buying this i added samsung 256gb ssd which costed me 6000 rupees. it would be best if u buy ssd version of this, 256 gb ssd is better than hdd any day. Go for the ssd version (strongly recommending)"
1510,3,Well the battery last upto 3-4 hrs on extreme usage and it has heating issues when it comes to high end usage. Overall this laptop is good for average usage. If you want to increase the speed you can later on add the ssd card however the feels good when it comes to quality.

1516,4,Am using this for last few weeks. Actually the product is really worth for money. Where the first fault I found with the system is regarding its speed. When it was running on HDD the system was too slow where we get mad on while working on it. But for this cost availing SSD is not possible. Thus later I enquired at a HP service center and added a SSD of 250 gb without loosing its warranty. Thus now it is having a good speed and a slight problem is of getting hang after sitting idel for a lon...

1529,3,Laptop is very slow.Booting time and time taken to open other things frustrates you.If you want optimum performance you need to add more RAM and also SSD storage.
1530,5,I got this machine in the big billion day sale & I must day it's a worth the money. Everything is upto the mark but it would be better if they had provided finger print sensor.
1531,5,"It's good but for decent gaming you should add additional ram to it for improvement. You can compromise with extra booting and loading time due to hdd, but you won't compromise with lag issues during game so it's highly recommend to upgrade its ram before ssd."
1532,5,Nice product I just love it.
1533,5,Superb in these price range because of hdd the performance is little bit slow those who want the best performance buy a M.2nvme Ssd and place in slot and see the performance it should like a beast .Battery bcakup was superb minimum 4-5 hours of normal usage and for gaming 2-3 hours
1534,4,awesome

1540,2,It takes long time for booting despite the fact that I have not installed any games or any softwares other than MS Office
1541,4,"Being a gaming laptop,it doesn't have it's own gaming command centre where u can switch between different profiles for gaming and where u can control fan speed and turbo boost."

1559,5,"This is an awesome laptop both the processor and graphics card are excellent. but with this particular variant, no SSD is pre-installed which makes the laptop laggy out of the box but don't worry there is a storage expansion slot in it and it only supports NVME M.2 SSDs. they are a bit expensive but it will make your pavilion a lot faster. so I recommend you not to play any heavy games or run heavy software. crucial p2 is a great option. you need to open the laptop and manually install it in ..."

1576,4,"Overall the laptop is amazing in this price segment bt i would recommend to buy the SSD version over this one. It takes approx 40 sec to start maybe this is due to lack of SSD , i might upgrade it later. It gives a battery backup of 4 hrs approx on normal usage. I haven't done any gaming yet on it. The speaker sound is decent , one can watch any movie without additional speakers in a closed room. The display is amazing , probably the best thing about this laptop. The colors are bright and I ..."

1582,4,"Bought this laptop after doing a lot of research, and I think it's not the best but hey, what can you expect within this budget? I had trouble running games like NFS Payback due to lack of RAM and fps drops playing GTA IV as well (i know about the bad port of this game tho). But then, I thought of upgrading the RAM a little before going for a SSD. After the RAM upgrade, I couldn't believe the improvement lol I had to Google why has my pic improved so much. I literally looked at some articles ..."
1583,4,"Nice lap, some small issue otherwise it was best laptop I like this"

In this laptop is very good and nice viewing angles also. This is something that other laptops dont have in this price range.  Perf...
1587,1,Laptop performance is to slow

1601,5,Awesome product People are saying that these machine is taking more booting time about 2 to 3 min I experienced about 30 sec as expected bcause hhd Bt i will upgrate to ssd soon and u will release the beast in it

1612,4,Overall nice laptop for gaming
1613,4,"GOOD product only but observed lag in processor, very slow booting"
1614,1,It might have great specs but it is slower than 4GB Ram laptops my friends are having. If you are from computer science background tell me how much time should a system take to import a small library like pandas mayb seconds. But it will take 2-3 minutes. It is that slow. Trust me.
1615,5,I can't express the happiness and the emotions that my parents and my family members give.They were appreciating me that what a laptop you have purchased. Very nice laptop.Super Speed and supper look!
1616,4,If anyone wants to buy this laptop consider buying ssd in advance because without ssd it is very slow it takes so much time for everthing to start..overall it is very nice product..
1617,4,"A very good product if you with HDD, battery is kind of okay if we compare for gaming laptops, this is perfect gaming beast but out of 8 gigs of RAM 2 GB is for Virtual memory of Vega 8 Graphics, rest 6 GB can be used for gaming. Sometimes you can get Stuttering issues in game because of less availability of RAM, but you can easily add more gigs of RAM to it, and it will become a beast"
1618,5,Sometimes i dont know why but when i switch on my laptop black screen appear and it get stucked there for more than 1 min which increases the booting time ..otherwise everything is fine and more thing sometimes it also misbehave ...üòê..battery backup is about 4 hours with battery saver mode and i dont know what will be thw backup in normal mode ..ya u can buy it ofcourse bcoz it is value for money

Games you want...including gta v, rdr2, etc. But the one thing I don't like on it is it's battery, it discharges very quickly on playing games...I was literally playing GTA San Andreas on it and it's battery decreases from 100 to less than 40% in just 1.5-2 hrs...it also has heat problem...but not too much...it's just a minor heat which cools down in less than 5 min.

RAM Mgmt is an issue as you get 6 GB for graphics and 6 GB for normal executions. (2 GB DDRAM is locked for graphics + 4 GB Nvidia). This will affect in prolonged usage.

The reason for making such a claim is because I had problems right from the start, the laptop kept shutting down, games were very stuttery etc. Now I will preface this by saying that, yes I have found the solution to all these problems and I shall list the respective fixes below. So I would encourage you to read through the full review before making a..."

1630,5,Very nice laptop.Though the ram us just 5.9gb but adding an extra 8gb makes it a beast.
1631,5,"What a wonderful laptop, I loved it"
1632,5,After buying this laptop add ssd and boot operating system with ssd ...it will give you faster experience.
1633,3,"Expected better performance, but great dissapointment. It was lagging like anything. For basic use its okayish.. When it comes to Designing softwares or games there problem starts. Looks so stylish and battery back was okay. Display not bad and at this price range MS office was not provided is something bad move from HP. If you are looking for gaming laptop pls go for something better. Flipkart delivery was not bad."
1634,5,Gud performance
1635,5,I am using it from last 15 days and now i can say.. First update this laptop completely and after compliting update 2-3 after you will found you are selected a amazing product.

1640,4,Except for the battery life and speaker volume laptop is pretty much good
1641,3,2400 MHz Ram shown but 2666MHz is inside. Overall good laptop but my laptops HDMI port stopped working after update. it seems incompatibitly of driver update with hp hardware ..
1642,1,Got damage battery. Charges very slow about 10% in 1 hour.
1643,1,Very worst product my laptop camera doesn't working and my laptop having 8gb ram but usable memory is only 5.9gb very worst and very slow laptop and hp coustomer care support also very worst service
1644,1,"Product Performance is very bad, no one called its gaming laptop, its take 90 seconds (1.5 minutes ) for the boot windows, it's very basic operation, that performance at an initial level from the first day, so think if after user 1-2 month and install some software, what performance expect from this laptop?  don't go to buy this laptop,"
1645,1,Somuch Hang.very poor to operate.

1647,5,Beautiful design u will love it. Loading time for Windows is little long Value for money
1648,2,Worst battery performance i have ever seen in the laptop..It take ages to get charged and take Mintutes to discharge. I want to return this product. What is the use of the laptop if i have to always keep it on charging? I am very disappointed with the HP..! Asus is way better
1649,5,Everything is fantastic but the display vibrates when working under the fan
1650,4,Very good laptop around 52 k. Go for it.
1651,5,Nice product but battery life is not that good
1652,5,Very good laptop and very nice looking
1653,3,Overall a good product but could be a bit more fast In processing aspects Experienced slow booting up and shutting down after 2 months of using it.....takes about 5 mins to boot up earlier it used to boot up in 20 secs  Noticed heating problems
1654,3,All works well only problem is it takes more time while booting. And feel slow when opening an app I think it's because of HDD
1655,4,"The design of the laptop is quite impressive. I bought the laptop with good expectations but to be honest, the laptop is not up to the mark. If you are a person who needs to run parallel applications at the same time, you will suffer a lot. It has been a week I got my laptop and starts to hang when I run some basic applications like Adobe leader, Chrome in parallel. I believe this is due to the fact that AMD reserves 2 gigs of RAM for hardware functioning which is a big drawback. I hope this ..."

I underclocked my maximum processor state to 95% and now it works. This laptop essentially cannot be boosted to it's 100% apart from that it delivers flawlessly.

1665,4,Product is very good. I like the design and performance of the laptop but its battery drains out much faster than I thought.

1667,5,Awesome product.. loved it
1668,1,Don't buy this product. Waste of money. Save your money. Iam disappointed but purchasing this.
1669,5,Awesome product takes a little time to boot up but definitely a pocket friendly gaming laptop. Mine took a little over 10 min to start maybe due to my internet problem but other than that it's too good
1670,5,Execellent
1671,4,"Design built good, display quality good Camera quality is not better At this price overall good"
1672,4,If you decide to buy this laptop be sure to add a decent nvme SSD and increase ram to 16gb.. once you do that you'll see the actual power of this mean monster.
1673,5,"I don't see the point of people complaining about this beast, i don't have any problems with this, it easily lasts for 5-6 hours in Normal use and performance doesn't let you feel the absence of SSD, when it comes to looks, backlit keyboard makes it look beautiful and premium, booting time is 8-10 seconds and charging is also pretty fast, definitely the best laptop in this price range"

1700,4,Product is good but I am not going to refer it for the processor. In this price range you should always go for i5. Otherwise it's good for gaming. I upgraded my ram and install one ssd for better performance.

1706,5,Overall a good laptop

1709,5,Got it for 48666 on offer running now Awesome laptop best budget laptop ever
1710,5,This a amazing laptop
1711,2,While working it is very slow and not running properly
1712,3,Fresh out of the box. Very laggy with COD warzone even at lowest settings. Watchdogs a 2014 game is also proving to be very laggy. I highly doubt if this Laptop can even play GTA5. Regret buying this Laptop for Gaming. Softwares like photoshop etc will work at good speed but disappointed with gaming.
1713,3,Giving review after 1 month First of all design is fabulous performace is ok booting time is not so good sometime it taker 2 min to boot up it is due to lack of ssd the bigest problem is its track pad which is not so good
1714,3,"Can't work in dark place as the keyboard has no light and on top of that the keys of the keyboard are also very dark. But the first time when I started the PC, the light was glowing."
1715,3,"I am giving this review after using for 2 months . First this lap is not for high lvl gaming it's for starting lvl or low lvl gamers . So my experience with this lap was not tht much good but it's ok first its battery and its backup yeah thts quiet fine üëçüëç ,the performance which I expected tht I didnt got so just think twice before u buy this lap"
1716,5,If you want a budget gaming laptop this is best for you. Important:- update to windows 10 2004 edition because it comes with windows 10 1903 version If you will not update then you can not play games because it hibernate automatically.
1717,3,There is a slight problem with speed. It doesnt have the speed of an 8gb ram device.
1718,5,Good
1719,3,Amazing product... But delayed delivery
1720,5,"Fantastic keyboard, nevada chip for gaming , dosent get heated...superb"
1721,5,Liked it. Fast delivery
1722,3,This variant is bit slow. The boot time is more than two minutes which is really a drawback of this model. Go for SSD variant to have faster performance. The design is awesome. The weight balance is so great tat you can open it with one hand without holding the base.
1723,4,"Laptop is awsome ,bulit is great, performance is great,but there is battery shortage (4hrs),otherwise great product ,value for money"
1724,5,Very good product for what you're paying. Flipkart delivery is poor. They took 10 days to deliver

1730,5,Best laptop under this price.. but it should come with a SSD so that performance can be better.. Overall good.

1732,5,Best
1733,3,Better to go for SSD
1734,5,No compromise in performance but boot time is taking a bit longer
1735,5,Nice product from flipkart
1736,3,Everything about the laptop is perfectly fine except the charger. I cant understand whether it is damaged or not as it is overheating within minutes of charging right from day 1. More to add....BATTERY IS TERRIBLE!!!!
1737,4,Great but slower than ssd version
1738,3,"Facing issue while charging laptop, , it took 2 hr for getting 10 % of battery charge and they say it's a fast charger. Don't know if it's a software issue or a manufacturing defect but I need a solution for it ASAP. And laptop get's heated."
1739,3,"better display , better design but without ssd it somewhere lag in the performance so its better if you purchase the model with ssd btw the product is good in it's range. I ordered this product 10 days ago and figured out a problem with the trackpad and opted for the return. They have taken time but cooperated and now they are replacing my product."
1740,5,Beast laptop at this price segment and after installing SSD it is far better than any laptop at 70k price segment
1741,5,Best gaming laptop at this price. Love it!!
1742,5,Outstanding performance üôå Outstanding battery Outstanding display üëçüëå
1743,2,Adaptor is heating very fast
1744,5,"This one is slow, needed to upgrade with ssd. Also 2gb ram is reserved for integrated graphics (Vega 8). Build quality is good , battery backup is good as many gaming laptop lack in this range, gives backup upto 1.5 hrs ultra settings gaming & 3-4 hrs of normal usage backup. Display is good. Just upgrade with 256gb Ssd & 8+8gb ram. Overall Gud choice in this range go for it."
1745,1,Varast product
1746,4,Good- would have been great with an SSD. Added on- but very good price. Fantastic value for money and performance
1747,4,Very good laptop for all rounder use .... Loving it.....
1748,4,very nice..
1749,5,System performance is pathetic. Running condition it's frequently shutdown without any warning. No solution from hp support' for the said problem. Don't know how to work with it.

1751,1,Very bad
1752,4,Awesome look and design
1753,5,Satisfied
1754,4,Over all good at this price range
1755,4,GOOD
1756,3,It was okay for the pice but hp should give upgradable ram upto32gb
1757,5,till now the laptop is working well and I have not faced any problem the performance is good got the product as expected
1758,5,"Good product ,go for it"
1759,2,Slowly workings
1760,1,Defected product : plays gta 5 at 4 fps when moving. Lags and stutters are unlimited . Didn't expect such things at 1650 gtx . Can't play a single Aaa game even in lowest settings. Complete garbage .
1761,5,best gaming laptop option in this range
1762,5,Best gaming laptop under 55k
1763,5,"I'll keek it short, The laptop looks amazing. CPU and GPU combo here work very well. You can play all modern AAA titles at 1080p medium to high settings at 60fps. I personally prefer playing at 1600x900, so that helps avoid any frame drops. There are some cons that i've listed below but overall this is the best option at this price point.  PROS: 1. The ultraviolet backlit keyboard along with the angular design looks really good. Gives it a very premium feel. 2. Good build quality, the materi..."
1764,3,You are getting a powerful GPU at this price range which is great. The looks are great too. Heating issue is there a little but not to worry about it too much. The main problem is with the reserved hardware memory (Only 5.9 gb Ram is usable out of 8gb) which makes multitasking and even gaming slow( Games may also crash for not getting sufficient Ram). You have to upgrade the Ram at any cost. (I haven't upgraded it I will write a review after I upgrading). You may also install an ssd if you ca...
1765,3,"I'm not sure, the features are great but the laptop is pretty slow. It takes a lot of time to boot. I have checked the reviews before purchasing but the laptop I received is not matching up."
1766,5,First of all thanks to flipkart for delivering it a day before delivery date. Packaging was done well. I was looking for a laptop fulfilling almost all my needs and it is the one.It has awesome look. It is working well while gaming as well as programming.The only thing it is lacking is absence of SSD that makes it somewhat slower. Apart from this it is upto the mark. Battery sustains for approx 4-5 hours. It is worth buying this laptop.
1767,3,Simply super
1768,4,Good looking..comfortable
1769,5,"I was a bit skeptical about buying this laptop as my first laptop with my first earnings. I didn't want regretful purchase. Although there were many powerful windows laptops, beefed up with specs in this category, I wanted one which could last for quite sometime and have decent battery life.  And since, it's a 'laptop' we should be able to use it on a lap and take it along while traveling with ease. These were my requirements. Being a PC user for the last 10 years, I was still going over whet..."
1770,5,"Highly recommended, the packing was fantastic, macbook feels very rich no doubt and it has its own fluidity, i m having a gr8 experience with this beauty after switching from a windows pc. Awesome product love u mac."
1771,4,"I wanted to buy a laptoo fir mild use which will serve me smoothly for atleast 4-5 years.. im a student and my parents use it just to browse , listen to music , facetime and all those basic things.. i dont about the technical aspects so I'll give a review thats more on the informal side.... The os is very smooth and easy to use and rhe best thing about macbook is that its more like an iphone.. you can download apps and you can make the same gestures on the touchpad as you would do on iphone ..."
1772,5,"apple is best among all, even it is 2017 model its design& day to day performance is fast, it's display is also good but not best as in highend models but it can complete the tasks it is better the other laptops at this price as it is apple, u will get blody satisfaction by this, no words to to express it."
1773,5,excellent performance as expected.Camera quality is very good compare to others.Battery life is just a nightmare for other laptops.This mac is best for those users whose idea empowers towards multitasking.Charging point is magnetic and protected from a cover.Long charging wire and a classic design.Overall a very good choice for multitaskers.Finally great delivery by flipkart everything is okay inside the box and packaging is just terrific
1774,5,A decent purchase at very low rate thanks to flipkart's sale offer..good packing and faster delivery. I found it a bit hard to use in the beginning since I was a Windows user for the past 12 years..but once your familiar it's really fun to use apple ecosystem..I would recommend as this is a good buy..since all the other newer versions of apple have USB type c ports which is not widely used which will result in buying an adaptor.
1775,5,"this is an awesome laptop it's good for programmers actually because programmers don't need much of video memory because there is not a lot of graphic intensive task that they do it's just about a good multi core processor. also when you have such a good build quality in a laptop you kind of are more focused into your work because you feel good when your working. :) and also there is a lot of online resources you can look come to for its review... thanks for making such good product, apple."
1776,5,"I bought this laptop after wondering if it's justified enough for me to purchase a MacBook Pro 13"" in India which costed nearly 122k with just 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD, now having purchased a base config MacBook Air, I am very happy, mainly because I was able to buy it for under 45k by exchanging my older Lenovo laptop which was giving me a severe headache.

I will suggest you to actually buy a back cover with the mac as well as it will help you to protect your mac much better. With each update the functionality becomes better. i will divide this mac in between pros and cons. PROS: 1) Battery life is amazing 9-10hours to the max even if you use it continuously. 2) Can edit videos...
1779,5,I am very happy with the product and the Flipkart services...guys don't go for other laptops in this budget....it's very smooth portable and good graphics too.....it's very good laptop for average users acc to me more than that...brand name also matters....the people who says dsplay is terrible I want to say to those guys that display is not bad ...it's very good ...the only drawback is viewing angle other wise 10 out 10 for dis laptop.
1780,5,this message is only for those who wants to learn or develop mobile apps. I bought this Macbook in November 2019. and the very first I installed android atudio. yes I'm an android developer. I tried running android studio and this beauty handles it very smoothly. I didn't faced any lag or hang. so I fired up android emulator too just to know if it can handle or not. But surprisingly the machine handled that too. I was amazed. There's some lag on emulator but it still handles it and doesn't s...

1784,1,quite frankly not worth in case you are looking to purchase a business laptop. just wasted my money on this product.  some negatives are mentioned below  1. in case you are extensive user of Excel sheets then this laptop is not for you.

1786,4,What can I say about this awesome product . Bought this laptop for android dev. Working like pro smoothly running all programs But having some heating issue sometimes feel cpu heating.
1787,5,I previously had one with 4 GB ram now I have the same config with 8gb. It works like a charm. Bit lag for Android studio and xcode. But that is ok since they are heavy softwares. Running simulators was pain in my 4 GB Mac but this one is pretty fast. If you are looking something for 4-5 years with medium to heavy use (I use my Macbook for 8-9 hours per day every day) and don't want to spend anything on maintenance Go buy it.

1794,4,"I bought this in 2018 January for a whooping 44500/- deal. Apple doesn't compromise on their quality on any of their products and specially on their Mac products.

1839,5,"Excellent system for middle class developers. I am a freelancer / mobile developer, I need both android studio and xcode. This system is enough to work with both platforms. Nice packing and delivery by flipkart."

1841,5,Wow the best laptop I have ever used!! It is an excellent piece of work done by apple. Mac os is simply the best os in the world. Once a Mac user always a Mac user.
1842,5,Apple..The name is enough to describe it's experience. it's awesome ... Very slim and smooth surface. just in love with it.
1843,5,Amazing product. Worth buying. With this price you will get high end specs with windows os but the stability of Mac os is 1000 tines way better than windows. Integration of external peripherals are ultimate. Watch videos if you are first time user.
1844,5,"Awesome product at such great price. On Flipkart got it with gud price tag, as compared to market with complete authenticity of product by Flipkart. Nicely packed and delivered by special delivery process by Flipkart.Purchased on 3 Sept and got delivered on 4 sept, Great delivery process by Flipkart."
1845,5,"very good product (light weight, high battery back up, reliable mac os, fast speed due to SSD and 8GB RAM, and doesn't heat up when used for long, and going by history of the product it should sustain all these good points even after years, unlike other laptops that deteriorate after few months or couple of years) and then unbeatable price as I bought it at final price of 48.5k"
1846,5,"worth every Penny!  Apple !

1848,5,Definitely one of the better laptops I have purchased. I have been using windows since the beginning and by beginning I mean windows 98 version. But am amazed by the ease of use of Mac os X. Contrary to the popular belief it's easy to use and surely very stable. The macbook air is very sleek and sturdy. It's been made to last. An enjoying working on it and will recommend it my friends.
1849,5,"Got it for 50.5K. Delivered in 4 days. Last BBD it was an ipad and this time it is a macbook air. Flipkart deserves all the commendation. About the product, silence is the best way to review this product. You have to see it and feel it to believe it. If it is your first apple product, you will just caress it for some days. If you have been a budget laptop user like me, the screen is infact an upgrade. There was hardly any better quality screen available in laptops if you have a 2-3 year old w..."
1850,5,"Firstly Delivery was superfast. Product was properly packed And sealed. Its an apple product, you buy it because u are used to premium and hassle free interface. I previously had a macbook pro 2012 model was quite satisfied with it. But it had hdd drive, so the processing got little slow over time and it couldn‚Äôt keep up with the regular software updates and it started lagging. So i decided to with the air, because the price point was good and the new generation air are really nice but are a ..."
1851,5,I purchased this laptop on march 14th 2020 and I have been coding in this since then only and it is awesome laptop and it doeanot lags as the windows laptops and it is runming smoothly even after so much of huge code and also i am using photoshop and it is working fine.Design is awesome and I like the keyboard and the glass touchpad of apple and it is simply marvellous.
1852,5,"very elegant. very satisfied. its the best amongst all. super fast operations, bright hd display, awesome sound quality and lightning fast processing. loved it."
1853,4,"A very good mac, low end but works well for lighter tasks. I myself code a bit, watch movies, browse, and edit photos with a breeze. You could push it to its extremes by doing video editing too. Overall most satisfying. A very good lappy at the budget. I am a CSE student so I did a bit of research before buying a lappy and decided on this one. If you have more budget then you can go for the new mac(2018 the one with Retina display and smaller bezels) which is totally awesome"
1854,5,Mac OS is smooth and easy to use.... absolutely best buy for 2019 too....go for it with out a second thought.... don't get into too much research on screen pixel etc etc....for a normal user it's THE BEST laptop....not for gamers for sure....
1855,5,Beautiful Machine with great speed and nice battery back up ! Absolutely no hang ..nothing .Finally it's apple !! One drawback what I would like to mention is storage ..it would have been 256Gb . Rest is absolutely fine . Recommend to buy it !
1856,5,"Due to 1.8 GHz processor speed little slow other wise excelent product. really apple is a best brand, I purchased it Rs. 52K in big billian sale 2018. it's good looking, light weight,with good battary backup."
1857,5,"Ultimate Product and Complete Peace of Mind !!  I bought Mac Book Air 6 months ago during great India shopping day, stunning slim look and lowest weight. Best part is longest battery back up of 8-9 hrs."
1858,4,"One word Worthy MacBook boot time and apps launches pretty quickly because of SSD. Processor is quite fast and keyboard haptic feedback is great, backlit light bleed is very less. Battery performance top notch. One thing that this laptop lack is screen quality and resolution.. But you always have port to connect it in BIG screen."
1859,5,"Got it for 42k after exchange offer during the diwali sale. Got an August 2017 manufactured model, checked the serial number in Apple site and sure enough it had 1 year warranty. Packing was good and laptop was protected well.  It came with Mac os Sierra out of the box and there's a free upgrade to the latest os High Sierra. Performance is silky smooth but there's a steep learning curve if you're coming from windows. Although it's thin theres a reassuring weight to the machine. Better to get ..."
1860,5,One of the finest product I have ever used in my life. Apple had really done very good job by manufacturing such a product within reach of a middle family income. Commendable job.
1861,5,"Good and fast ,only limitation is 128 gb storage,upgraded from Catalina to BIG SUR ,many good features like my iPhone and iPad mini get connected so that I can pickup phone from laptop MacBook Air itself and no need to enter passwords etc provided u have same Apple ID ,compatible with Microsoft PowerPoint which I purchased separately"

For video editing for many layers and clips not suitable (suitable for inroom simple videos)"
1863,4,I could say this is the one of the best investment I have done.  The macbook air works perfectly for all my home and office work. The i5 processor is simultaneously able to handle the : -  1. Four Google Chrome Tabs 2. Three excel sheets 3. Two Word documents. 4. Microsoft Teams 5. Netflix 6. Youtube  I have not been able to find any performance issues so far. The applications switch smoothly between each other. The video call on Teams works perfectly without any glitches. The sound quality...
1864,5,"It is my first time when i was working on Macintosh and i am really impressed. It's been 7 months i have been using it, it never hanged till date and performance is great as compare to windows . For windows user who are facing issues with chrome, they will definitely go in love with this laptop. Battery backup is also good, it gives around 8-9 hrs of backup, if you are continuously working on it. Overall it's a good package, just go for it ."
1865,5,"I was little bit hesitant while buying it but since my wife loves Apple a lot, so it was the best gift option for me on her birthday. she was awfully struck with surprise while unboxing the pack.I have happily migrated from Windows to Mac now, its robust, stylish and exorbitant speed. perfect purchase. Thank you Flipkart and Seller"

1868,5,"After using Windows for more than a decade, I started using iPad. Impressed by the user friendliness of iPad I bought macbook air.  Pros: Very light, Long battery life (about one day of use), User friendly, very stable system (does not hang or crash), very good sound and picture quality, good metallic built, the experience of the mac ecosystem (iPad+macbook+iPod) is simply mind blowing (specially the air drop feature).  Cons: If you are planning to play games....this is not for you, this is a..."

The Build quality is premium which we expect from Apple. 2. The person who wants to install IDE's for development purpose, these IDE's run extremely well and this laptop is also good for video editing purpose. 3.

1872,4,"Good laptop. For people who have normal use like for office. This is perfect. However, battery could have improved more. Charger cable get torn after few months, would recommend people to buy spiral band to avoid any wear and tear in cable."
1873,5,Got it in 47000 in Big Billion Sale 2018. Being a Windows user I must say MacBook is amazing. Initially it might feel a little odd in getting comfortable with the UI but once you are comfortable nothing stops you. A Linux user can easily familiarize himself with the OS. Boot Time and Battery backup is the best part. Storage size is a bit of a concern.
1874,5,"no matter what, Macbook is always way ahead of its competitors in case of performance. Although screen is not a retina display but far far better then other windows laptops. Good for daily light usage. Fast to boot and easy to use. You can also do light weight development as well. Works absolutely fine with IntelliJ."
1875,5,"Amazing product. I got it for my development and believe me it works so well with Android studio, jet brains ide. Till now no performance issues."
1876,4,"First, Flipkart is just too good at delivery! Product is perfect. Bought it in a hurry in the festive sale, as Apple raised the price of even the old model of Air by 17k. Overall. The product is good, handles office level multitasking pretty well. Though I had two instances of a slight lag for 3 seconds... (I had 25 application windows open at that Time). Typing is a breeze, adjust the keyboard setting ls to your speed, and it's great. The fluid design of the OS is known to all. Battery stan..."
1877,2,"Display sucks, battery life is great, portable enough so don't think of weight, battery life good enough you don't have to carry n charger everytime"
1878,5,"The product is insane. Superb speed and finesse both in terms of looks and in terms of performance. For people who fear they worked kn windows their entire life and now mac might be difficult, go buy it man.. nothing like that..you can learn it in a day..its amazing.. worth buying at this amazing price.."
1879,5,"So much Happy.. The Macbook Air is good and premium.The most youtube review says its display and viewing angles are bad but its not true.its having decent display look good,if you are moving from Windows to Mac using 30-40k windows laptop then you cant have any single complain.Besides the storage you can use an external Hard Drive for storing moving and extra stuff for normal storing purpose its great with required software in it. I so happy to get this device."
1880,5,"It's an Apple product so rest assured your not going to be disappointed even the slightest, great battery life, nice display, smooth Mac OS, can do casual gaming, top notch creativity machine. Fast delivery by Flipkart and great customer support. Money spent well"
1881,5,"It was very well packaged and delivered on time. Works like a dream, boots in seconds, even faster than some phones! Very smooth and is really good for web browsing, watching movies, light video and photo editing- that means you can edit vlogs easily in HD quality. Happy with the battery backup lasts close to 5-6 Hrs depending on the usage. Really happy that I didn‚Äôt buy windows at the same price!  Go for it, you won‚Äôt regret this super light robust laptop!"
1882,5,"Product is good. Very thin, light weight and portable. Although storage is very less only 98gb available from 120gb. Only 2 usb port. Charging adaptor is very handy easy to cary.  Editing the review after updating to big sur, it really lagging now. A windows laptop with ssd is much better than MacBook, because in future updates there are not going to slow down there machines intentionally. So that user buy the new one. Not value for money."
1883,5,"My Review after one month of usage. I would like to say Awesome product, Awesome Service, Awesome Delivery. Thank you Flipkart, Apple and Ekart Logistics as well."
1884,5,"It's awesome. I was waiting to buy this from long time. Finally I bought it at very good price 43k, thanks Flipkart sale.  For 43k I got MacBook air 2017. MacOS will blow ur mind. It's worth every penny your are paying. Everyone know the pros, the only con is screen. But trust me guys display is still awesome. It gives immense pleasure to work on Mac. It's must buy unless you are a gamer."
1885,5,"I got it at 49K, I was planning to buy one from Inspire at 60K. Got it at best possible price, in best possible packing and it got delivered within 3 days from the day I placed an order.  Thanks to Flipkart - Best e-commerce product in India."

Pros Nearly no virus problem Starts very fast Looks so premium and out of the league. Light weight... Conclusion is hardware n build quality is best no point of comparison.  Cons for Windows user Mac OS. Not so user friendly. When u stuck on something u have to do it using script on command prompt linux based.  No HDD only SSD of 128gb No CD Rom N...

Bought it on big billion day offer.Its my first Apple product.Its easier than Windows as per me.It has a very classy look and sturdy built quality.Its very light compared to other laptops.The display is bit low,but we have to sacrifice atleast one to this stunning device.Finally I loved this superb product from Apple and lots of thanks to Flipkart for its good packaging service.Obviously I must rate this product 5‚≠ê."

1890,5,"I have been using macbook pro since 2 year. Now on flipkart exchanged with this macbook air at first glance it's pretty good looking device, thin, very light, attractive. Performance is good. Best part is TouchPad, smooth operating system which makes it different. People will say I'm using macbook so I'm telling all good about it but i sah try and see ur self. It's very nice to have a basic light weight and pretty good laptop."
1891,5,it's just a nice product
1892,5,This is my 2nd Macbook air. The best part about this laptop is you can also use windows operating system with this.
1893,5,When open the flap and start it you get the feel of this big package come in small size and elegant design . Finest creation of apple is helping out people to give an unprecedented experience of finesse quality speed performance and user friendly interface alongwith beautiful ergonomic design . Hats off

1898,1,quality is not good. keypad is not as apple is known for. as i think you will find better option in this price. I will not recommend for this product. total wastage of money. only those who have extra money they buy and give good review but if you really care for money never go for this product. Performance is not good after using a week. sound quality is average color is average most bad thing is its keypad. as i am using mackbook pro there is a lot difference in keypad. just buy if you ...
1899,5,I have been an apple fan for the last 20 years and continue to be one.  The MAC Air has been a long cherished need for my work and it fits in well. The form factor and functionality is enviable.  With the numerous apps that are available. It is indispensable as a working tool.
1900,5,"I had planned to buy this during the Big Billion Day Sale. With special discount on cards etc. i got a great deal. Now if one can compare it with any other windows laptops from good brands, this is cheaper or almost equivalent. But user experience from this product is butter smooth. Have been using since Oct '2018. No complaint. I have switched, in fact, from windows to Mac OS and found why people prefer Mac. And, thanks to Flipkart for making the product affordable."
1901,5,without a doubt I trust Flipkart. such a wonderful product received in perfect packing. @ just 49990 on big billion day. No one can beat this price. In Apple store it was available for 69500. Thank you Flipkart.

Basically use it for normal browsing and nowadays for kids online classes. Working well. Battery life is 6-7 hrs. Standby mode is good where the battery is in very minimal use. But we are not buying this expensive product for standby mode. Processor is fast and very responsive. That's the best part. Really good for kids to prepare ...
1912,5,"Earlier I was a windows user and used a Dell Inspiron for almost 8 years. As I passed out of college, now my requirement from my laptop changed. I wanted a laptop which is rigid, descent looking, compact in size and most important the battery backup. MacBook Air proved itself in every aspect I wanted. I am really happy with the product and I will recommend this product for all the professionals. I got this laptop for 52k with my old laptop exchanged."
1913,5,"I am a B.Tech CS student. I am using it. It's just awesome. it's so light weight that you can carry it anywhere. the battery is so oooo good. Also it opens matlab and Pucharm in just 7 sec and 5 sec respectively, which is mind blowing . The storage which you get it out of the box is 98 gb, which is not actually sufficient but you can manage easily if you are a professional user., and doesn't like useless things in your pc. Believe me You will love it."

1962,5,"Pros-: Super smooth. Awesome performance and much better experience than any high end windows PC. I am running cloudera Hadoop without any issues. Battery lasts for at least 10-12 hours. Web cam is average.  Cons-:  Only down side is display which is ideal for web surfing or coding but difference arises when you watch movies or videos.  Highly recommend for working professionals, coders, internet surfing etc. But not for gamers or watching movies."
1963,5,"Purchased it a month ago. So far going extremely well. Performance is mind blowing. Touch, screen quality and other aspects are good as per the apple standards. Overall worth product to buy!! - - - - Its been 2 years now and laptop is still working pretty smooth"

1965,5,"Honest review. Well, the name is enough ofcourse. Works pretty fine as long as you work normally. Laga at times opening large files. For the first 6months the battery backup was like 10-11hours but now its like 5-6 hours max. Heats up like a burner if you work while charging. Got this for 44500 , yeah okay its so so."
1966,5,"No doubt, an excellent laptop. if your preference is portability and long battery life, I think this is the best you can ever find. I am comfortably getting more than 12 hours continuous-usage battery back up. Also the charging is very fast. It hardly takes 1.5 hours for full charging from less than 10% to 100%. I need not specifically say anything else, since Apple is always known for making elegant products."

1978,4,"I would be just unbiased and honest here. This is an Apple product, so definitely it's accessories and Softwares which you'd buy are also gonna be a bit on the higher side of the scale. With 13.3 Inch of size, LCD screen (which is far better than those yesteryear LCDs), this is a hefty pricing product.

The laptop runs really smooth. MacOs is simply the smoothest and richest operating system. If you want a laptop that 'looks' awesome, this is the best option. At a price of 55K INR, it is a steal. Otherwise on paper, specs may not seem awesome, but these laptops are not sold because of their specs. They are ..."
2079,5,Good product with this price 56k
2080,5,Got it at a discounted price while opting for the No Interest EMI scheme. Flipkart delivered the product very next day. Packaging was good and solid. On unboxing got a perfectly sealed MacBook Air in the box. Just love how sleek and polished the laptop is. Coming from the 2011 MacBook unibody(lasted me 7 years and still working) this is a very welcome upgrade. The specs are more than sufficient for my day to day work and business travels.
2081,5,"Worth the penny... I was afraid about the online purchase, but Flipkart didn't made me down. It was all perfect and the MacBook Air- an awesome product by Apple. I love it"

Ssd quickly opens everything Short on storage (purchase an external hard disk or jetdrive or something like it) Battery backup the best off all laptops, more than 12hrs of backup working on docs and listening songs. Magsafe charges even quickly. Less ports so separate adapters are must Overall bestbuy at this pricepoint"

2090,5,The Macbook Air is an amazing product. It's a piece of art. Since last 20 years I have been using Windows PC so I was bit nervous if I will be able to adept to Mac.

2128,1,"The rating given is based on the experience I had. Bought this product on Big billion day Oct'19, within a week I had to take it to service center. Issues I faced was - 1. Heating. 2. Not booting and showing black screen. 3. And finally it stopped working and not able to switch it on."
2129,1,Not worth it to buy such a overly priced and overy hyped device. Its repairing costs more than the actual CP. This is horrible. Had to shed another 45000 for repairing its logic board.

I contacted flipkart customer care and got immediate response that as i am still under warrenty so I shall get free service from icare. I contacted icare and you cant believe they have replaced the charger COMPLETELY FREE OF COST!! so it is myth that online product doesnot comes with warranty."
2157,5,After 2 months : I can definitely assure you that you'll not be returning to the windows again after using mac... Everything is so simple and very well managed... Strongest point is it's battery... Sometimes I've got 14-15 hours of battery backup... In 60 days of usage I've just charged it 22 times (Voila! Yes you can see the number of times you've charged your Mac)...I would definitely recommend it to everyone because I'm really happy with my MacBook... I've recommended it to many of my frie...

My experience on very first day few keys are not working and I reached out to the Flipkart and they gave me response stating to visit and nearest mac service center. There is no replacement for the product and the solution for this fix is they need to replace whole keyboard. I am not happy because at the end I will be getting the repaired product and not the new one. ...

2245,5,If you want performance only go for it... Good for programmers
2246,4,"I have no words to describe about it, mind blowing"
2247,5,"Perhaps my biggest purchase online, thank u Flipkart for the offer on the product, speed is lighting fast and needless to talk much about apple which is world acclaimed. Happy to have bought the product and serves my purpose of drafting on the go"
2248,5,"While purchasing, I was a bit sceptical because of the specs of the laptop. But believe me, this laptop runs fast. Just keep in mind donot open too many Tabs of google chrome. The laptop had increased my productivity since it forces me to do one task at a time. Display is not that good. It will keep reminding you how old this model is. Other than that, this model is good for development work."
2249,4,so good
2250,5,It is the best laptop at the price 54990/-
2251,5,Best in style Best IN brand Best IN performance Best in class

2260,5,Best laptop ever for students using it from last 2 years and it still feels like new. amazing performance and battery life.
2261,5,If you wanna buy laptop and you budget is 60k then go for it

2281,1,When I start after shutdown then mouse doesn't work and while updating OS also it failed after 99 % every time. Processing speed is too slow. They mentioned it has i5 processor but it doesn't work like that. Webcam quality is too bad.

2290,1,"--- UPDATE AFTER 10 DAYS: --- The backlit is flickering on 10th day. Flipkart says they won't replace the item, Apple says they'll be charging for it and I'm absolutely stuck between the two. It seems that I've lost my 60k spent on the product. DO NOT BUY FROM FLIPKART guys, buy from some place where they take responsibility for it.  --- OLD REVIEW: ---  Incredibly happy with my Macboook. A bit slow but difference is negligible, can't believe its so fast even with a 5th gen i5. Highly recomme..."

2292,1,product is gud but flipkart is a big big big lier... taking orders by showing great schemes like exchange but simply refusing to accept the exchanged products even for normal wear and tear of the product... a big fat fraud ecommerce... a big Noooooo to flipkart in future

2403,5,"As I have to work on Android studio. Its performance is quite well. You can even open two instances of studio even though you don't feel a glitch or hang like in Windows. As it's new, for it's long lasting review we have to wait for a year. Only one issue is it's less memory i.e 128 hard disk. It's ssd that's good. If you have a portable hardrive then it's ok."
2404,5,"i think that this is one of the best product Apple has made. Thanks to Steve Jobs.  Display is good. There are many people who complain that it is not good compared to newer models but it gets all the things done without any hassle. For the rest, everything is best."

2431,5,Awesome
2432,4,Product was genuine but 1 star reduced for slow delivery. I expected 2 day delivery but Flipkart took 4 days to deliver it.
2433,5,Apple is Apple. No One one can beat it  Pros: Best battery life Negligible boot time Powerfull machine Sleek and premimum design  Cons: Less storage but that can be overcome by having external Hard disk. Not for hardcore gaming  P.S: Purchased at Rs:45k  So if your budget is less than 50k go for it!

The delivery was delayed due to big billion day sales. It was delivered in good condition. Although one cons is it gives shocks when connected to charger. The shock is not noticeable so it's not a dealbreaker. Other than charging time, it doesn't gives a shock."

2492,5,The Laptop is too good. If you want middle range macbook you can go for it. The package from filpkart is also upto the mark. Battery backup is solid. You have to purchased Office 360 for microsoft word and excel. Also you can update new software update. Just go for it you'll not regret..    Only thing is Rom 128GB but if you have external hard disk then its not that much problem. I'm using this macbook with 1TB HDD
2493,5,"Excellent product!! Got it for 41k including discounts, exchange, cashback...price made it sweeter!! Performance wise, i just felt resolution should have been more. Rest all good."
2494,5,Undoubtedly the best laptop with the budget of under 50K go for it! It is really great!
2495,5,"Got it for 43k from sale. And It has all , what you expect from a macbook."
2496,4,"Too soon to write a review about the product. It's a plain old MacBook Air. Plenty reviews available. So just writing about flipkart experience. Got a great deal during their festive sale, So that's nice. Delivery was very slow. Five days. Amazon delivers within 48 hours. Get some protective gear in time so you don't have to be extra careful handling it Update 1: A minor problem made me see the service center who the next day told me that they will have to replace the logic board because of w..."

2502,5,Awesome product at awesomest price...got at 45k really happy about it.. :-)
2503,5,Very good laptop specially battery life.Purchased for tractor pro dj software. Delivery was well before time by Flipkart
2504,5,Good packaging After 5 day of use I will say that it's a little beast that beats windows based machine in every aspect. It's rightly said. First impression is the last impression. I got it for 45k in big billion day sale. It's worth. Don't hesitate just go for it.
2505,5,It's divert before .. packing was quite good .. Manufacturing 2017 Aug i was worry about that but it's recent model ..
2506,5,Got a awesome deal with exchange....
2507,5,Amazing product - apple products dont need words.
2508,5,This is the newer version with latest 2017 Sierra OS. It comes with 8GB ram. 10 hours battery life on full charge. full aluminum body.  Go for it.
2509,5,Very good product ...great changeover for Me from Windows to Mac... way to go with Mac...
2510,5,Impressive!!!
2511,1,Damage product send so I suggest do not buy.
2512,5,Who else got it for 38K :D
2513,1,Don't buy these expensive items from Flipkart rather go to store and get new sealed pack from them after a week of purchase it started getting automatically turnedoff due to add error I don't know what the fraud being done by the Flipkart or their seller it haven't worked great my colleagues also have same and it is working fine even after 2 years . And Flipkart don't even provide replacement for these if something bad happens .
2514,1,"Within two months it's stopped, I try to on but it not working"
2515,5,"Too confused to write any review. The product do not have any issues. But there is a but that I am unable to explain myself. So decision is all yours if you want go for it, if you do not want don't go for it."
2516,5,"Itz have been 90 days after buying this. Such a awesome product.. No drawbacks.. High performance,No lagging,No battery issues,10 hour battery backup,no charger problem.. üîπOnly problem is charger will heat much more we can prepare Tea or Omelet with this heat üòÅ. Just with one word about this Mac is """" Beast""""."
2517,5,This is one of the best MacBook from Apple. Even it is performing much better than the latest version of MacBook Air.
2518,2,If you want to buy it for that Apple logo and amazing build quality it will be a great buy... the problem is actually in mac os... If you switching from windows to mac( in this case you most probably are) you are actually downgrading in terms of os.. Mac is no where close to windows... You will feel cramped you won't find lots of handy options... Dragging is such a mess... And lot of such problems... That even you get familiar with the os you are going to miss tha windows os.
2519,5,nice prodect
2520,5,This machine is great...for everyone except gamer....you see the specs are not so good as per price but the performance is better then i7 16 gb ram Windows laptop
2521,5,product.... is good.... i bought this mac at 45k recently....i dont know the real price exactly may be 60k or 70k....so guys out there wait for proper time and bye it.... If ur confuse buying mac 17 or other laptop -gamer these mac isnt for u -storage is low.... bt it dsnt matter me much coz i use for only for study purpose jst by saving pic n documents or any study matetial....i use it for watching movie.... later i delete that movie....these is how i save my storage *if u want to known more...
2522,5,nice product.fast deliver....love it
2523,5,"Laptop is super good, there is no need for a r view. But one main thing is seller's packing. It was packed carelessly with some Buble wrap pieces here and there. Apple's boxing for the MacBook was in bad shape when delivered. A simple footwear deserves better packing"
2524,1,Ok ok don‚Äôt worth it
2525,5,If you want apple you can buy this.  If you want laptop which will be useful for coding video editing and other stuff choose other brands   Apple is selling 10 rupees product for 1000 price with apple logo.
2526,1,"Very,very disappointing. Was expecting top-notch performance but found quite a lot of issues making it a deplorable experience for me. I moved from Windows for a better experience but clearly, it was a mistake."
2527,4,"go for it in 2020 or 2021...Why not...??? It is batter than windows i7 and most of i5 super fast, world class designe, super display, long battery Once you use, you love mac OS I wiil get it only 45k in BBD 10/10/2018"
2528,1,Wrong please don't place order from this side or application it's worthless.. I purchased mackbook i5 but I saw a lot scratches in display after opening... So please don't purchase any apple product from this application (Flipkart)
2529,1,the battery is draining very fast even with just internet surfing
2530,1,It is not so good as I thought before buying. Speed is almost same. Only you boast of brand name. It not so user friendly. Ms office is not there.
2531,1,Good product but price varies
2532,1,I bought a macbook air 2017 and it gives reapeated shocks while switching it on... It has some serious heating issues.. And guess what.. IT GOT STUCK AND DOESNT MOVE. AND THE ARROW KEYS FOESNT WORK ANYMORE!!!
2533,2,"don't buy this Laptop, the Mac Book Air very bad quality parts, this should be repair after 10 month or 15 months, the repair cast near 43000/- , if you ready pay next 43K , you will buy , or should be buy extend warrant , if not don't buy this Mac book. I am not understand the Big Apple product is very bad."
2534,3,Great
2535,2,Pathetic product delivered by flipkart. Charger stopped working after 7 months and even the mousepad. System shuts down abnormally. No response taken by flipkart so far after sending multiple emails. Waste of money and mentally harassing.
2536,1,"Never trust flipkart for these products. After 5 months of the purchase my laptop's motherboard is damaged without any reason at all. The charge doesn't stay even for 5 hours. I truly regret buying it from here. Flipkart sells defective products. This one was a replacement, still it didn't work.  I will never recommend flipkart to anyone."
2537,3,Keyboard stopped working after 2 months
2538,4,Amazing quality
2539,5,The product is great. I will highly recommend this to everyone who is interested.Go for it guys.It is worth every penny üòä
2540,5,Very nice products.
2541,5,Good but price high
2542,1,"I have purchase this product before 1 year 4 months ago, but now it is dead. When i go at apple repair center then they asked me around 42000Rs for fix the issue in my Macbook air, But before one year when i was purchase this at cost 64000Rs... This is wrost product that i have purchase in my life.... please do not purchase this product... This is waste of money....."
2543,5,Perfect
2544,5,Awesome product Thanks Flipkart Delivered also in Lockdown period .
2545,4,I have bought this for 51K. best price and best choice.
2546,5,"Not as good as other model of mac book air, motherboard get crash in just 4month."
2547,5,As seen and shown in product image display exactly same product arrived. Highly recommended to put a screen guard along with the skin cover for any further scratch on the body of the product Otherwise too good product to use.
2548,5,"product is awesome as it is Apple products , but taking from. Flipkart is not good"
2549,1,don't buy MacBook from flipkart
2550,5,"Awesome price, Awesome product, Value for money. Flipcart delivered BEFORE time. Thanks a ton."
2551,5,Hi Team Battry Bacup not giving
2552,1,charget not found
2553,4,All are good but large excel files are not open in number application. Need to download MS office for work . Only this the main problem otherwise its a mind blowing product
2554,5,"Awesome product, I bought this laptop on Big billion days, I got for 50k, wherein there was extra 10% off on only HDFC card which I didn't possess, so have to bear the pain of paying extra 5k.  product is worth of paying so much and also performance is good, if your thinking to buy personal laptop for atleast 2 - 3 years without any hassle then this is the right product."
2555,2,I think window is better system Crashes
2556,4,product is good and is performing well with latest OS Packing was very good and delivered safe..
2557,5,Very nice product apple MacBook air
2558,5,Superb product
2559,2,Nice but build quality of macbook air is not as robust as before. Backplate knocks when u hold it in hands. It knocks continuously when u use it in bed or Diwan cot. Absolutuley annoying for this half lakh worth product.
2560,3,"Pros Delivery on time. Awesome laptop in terms of speed, performance, battery back is just superlative..runs thru the day on a single charge even a mobile phone battery doesnt last as long in most cases.  Cons But the laptop screen hinge is loose, on minor movement of the laptop the screen flips back. one of the usb port has some issue, two clips/strips of metals in it are not in line with the slot and therefore difficult to insert pen drive/hdd."
2561,5,The macmachine is awesome but the delivery by Ekart logistic was pathetic.The delivery guy named Ramakant was rude that can not be expressed.Only in Indian companies this kind of employees can be seen.Foreign companies will not hire such kind of staff who will destroy the fame and image of the brand towards the customer.
2562,4,1 star cut for non availability of CD player in MacBook otherwise awsum
2563,5,My love..... Simply awesome performance new macbook air 2017
2564,5,Small and elegant laptop that can carry anywhere you want. Powerful machine. Awesome design
2565,5,Amazing machine. Absolutely love using the MacBook.Great battery backup.Very advanced engineering is involved in this machine.Just go for it.
2566,5,Stunningly superb
2567,1,I buy this one here on flipkart on oct 17 th i have warntry i didnt use much also but the apptronix guy is saying that it is liquid damage warrantry wont cover wrost product ever dont buy any apple products on online
2568,1,MAC is not for India because most of supporting app and software are not working with mac operating system. Therefore apple should bring laptop with window Microsoft or substitute of Mac so that we can use. otherwise it is only box. Another point I want to add that b2 b GST invoice is not issuing to customer. Although they are charging GST. not issuing of B2B GST invoice is red alert...??
2569,1,bettery performance not upto the mark
2570,4,It's a good product but not value for money
2571,3,Still using it almost like 1 year  Battery is best in the work   Rayanmotovlog summer vlog YouTube
2572,5,It's performance is so consistent and optimised.. it is almost unbelievable.. it performs better than my pc with i5 10th gen
2573,4,"Happy with product, but have issues on battery backup... Soon I will visit apple store... But I think flipkart member can look this matter seriously.. For future improvements"
2574,5,"the best option for the ones looking to buy a machine with a good battery backup and do editing and stuff. It's overall good for everything, if it's a movie or music, it will fit well. Yes, you can't play games, its a mac. other than that, it wont disappoint you."
2575,1,Battery backup is 3~4 hrs and this was not accepted by apple. No return option from flipkart.
2576,1,not good quality
2577,5,awesome product saves lot of time
2578,1,Product is not user friendly no lan port at all. More over the return scheme from Flipkart not allow you to return if u r not satisfied.
2579,1,In 10 days my os freezes and crashes this is very very very bad experience.this problem is solve by apple customer service but my important data is lost mahine is very good but update all app and system is necessary
2580,3,"1.Performance is awesome 2.battery back is just 4-5 hrs..if u r playing games, battery drains fast..limited gaming support.. 3.good for professional and basic uses.. 4.display, sound quality is good.. 5.overall product is good except battery backup as mentioned in product description 10-12hrs I did not get till now. 6.it gets heated sometimes when using android studio emulators and when multiple chrome tabs(more than 10 tabs) are opened"

2588,5,Best laptop in 48k...
2589,1,This macbook started giving problem after few months and after around 8 months i stopped all of a sudden. when i went to apple customer care they opened it and found one rust dot on mother board though there was no liquid spill or physical damage. initially i was told it is not covered in warranty but After few calls with customer care they considered it a design issue and replaced the motherboard in warranty. I bought apple products in USA too and never faced any quality or service issue. Se...

Major points for the exellent performance :) Pt. 1 -> Make sure you are in a cool room while using the mac because it comes with the thermal cooling. Pt. 2 -> try not to upgrade you software to Big sur if it comes with Catilina. As you will face Battery drain issue sometimes. Pt. 3 -> You can continuously use your mac upto 6-7 hours.

But, this product is very precise in every manner (convince, battery backup, processor speed, look, adepter). Only one thing i.e. storage space is little bit small. Rest is fine. At this price ( 58000 Rs) this product is nice."

2671,5,Just Amazing
2672,5,Good
2673,5,Loved the product. Everything is cool about this laptop. I got macbook air with laminating apple logo design at the back of display. I liked it
2674,4,Though it's an old version but working well. Switching from Window to Mac was completely new experience but loved it. My daughter is enjoying her online class from mobile to Mac... Camera and sophisticated charger still a concern but overall deserve ****
2675,3,ROM is less due to which it run slow.
2676,5,This is the last macbook that you can buy which can be repaired by outside technician. I got my old one repaired 3 times. The newer macbooks are literally unrepairable by third parties. So if you are buying a macbook and do not want to spend extra with apple guys. go for this one.

2743,5,The product is no doubt superb but the exchange policy of Flipkart is worst. I had a very bad experience this time. Even I plan to cancel the order. The wish master or the guy who come for exchange is only giving 2000/- of my old laptop where as I am expecting 8500/- for the exchange value. The guy later confirm that we never give customer to there desired value. Finally I end up with cash value for the order and plan to sell my old laptop myself

2818,5,"A macbook at this price is a steal but it's not useful for anything other than light browsing, working on ms office (will have to spend extra on that) and other light applications. This is a 2017 model with an older gen processor. It might get Big Sur but any update beyond that is a question mark. Also the display tech is very old.

2842,5,"Read it carefully!  Before going to buy a Laptop full with new specifications, just remember one thing; ""Apple sabka baap hai"". My Macbook Air was manufactued on September, 2020 and the best part is it comes with Mac OS Catalina. I upgraded it to Mac OS Big Sur. Believe me, there is even no lag while even importing or exporting videos in iMovies (jo nhi jante ho, yea KineMaster ka baap hai, apple ka apna in-built app).

2871,4,I had recently purchase this Macbook Air 2017 model on 21st October. I was concerned by reading online reviews about this seller TrueComRetail.  I received the product on 28th october.

2880,5,I am happy. This device is really good. Design was really very cool. Light weight. I love this.
2881,4,Purchased during Flipkart Big Billion Days 2020. No doubt mac is always a best choice as far as it's performance is concerned. Found only 2 cons. 1. Battery is giving hardly 6 hrs backup. I was expecting minimum 8 hrs backup with my limitation usage as browsing and YouTube. 2. Adapter gets heated very high whenever I charged in 1 shot from 10% to 90% .  Rest everything is Good.

2907,4,"There is absolutely no comparison between MAC & Windows. This is the best operating system in terms of performance, durability & battery backup which is very well complemented by it's asthetics.  Packaging is top notch (as expected)  What is astonishing for me is the delivery time and below average customer service. This is indeed an area worth looking at. Hope Flipkart take necessary actions to ensure product should reach within the date of commitment."

2917,5,I got a recent and Aug manufactured Macbook and not from old stock. Only problem I can see in 15 days usage is that the power adapter/brick is getting very hot while charging despite it being the new MagSafe 45W power adapter. I raised the issue with Apple Care but yet to get any satisfactory resolution.

2988,4,"The product was amazing, The outer box was damaged severely, But the laptop box inside survived. The delivery guy is bad, He told to come to logistics store for pickup, He didn't come for delivery. . . The product was amazing. Worth for 60k, . . For a product worth 60k a customer will expect faster delivery and good packing, But Flipkart failed in both, It took a week to deliver it and the outer box was severely damaged. . . Flipkart is worst, If you want this laptop, better buy in some other..."
2989,5,What a product. Macbook air is amazing. If you thinking to shift from windows to mac I am damn sure that you are not going to regret..
2990,5,Loveliest Mac‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
2991,5,I brought it in big billion days of 55000 rupees. I am the lucky one who get it in 2019 as apple upgrade Mac book air in 2020 and now old version is not produce by company. This is best Mac book for students. None of windows laptop can beat the performance of this Mac book in same cost. And of course Mac operating system is more powerful as compared to windows in terms of coding or video editing.
2992,5,Worthy of money
2993,5,Awesome apple product. But I don't know how it's possible. I got sealed box but when I opened it I have found some scratches on the charger.
2994,5,Toooo good ... Can't believe this lappy is thinner than my realme smartphone
2995,5,Fall in love with this
2996,5,Good
2997,1,Received a Macbook with a big scratch on the back of display. I have applied for a replacement.
2998,5,üëçüëçmust have even its 2020
2999,5,Performance and battery are just amazing. That's all we need l.
3000,5,I am a Software Developer !! Ordered this after doing a very long research. Good for everything !! Nice battery (will update after 1-2months). Display is also good. One can use external monitor for photo or video editing. Go for it guys.  Will update a details review after using it for long time.
3001,5,Superb quality ‚ù§Ô∏è it
3002,5,Reviewing after one year of use. Pros- 1.Best performance and around 7-8 hours battery. 2.Best software experience.  Cons- 1.Bezels are slightly bigger as compared to other laptops. 2.You can't play games in this laptop because it's macosüòÅ .  Overall the best laptop for students for coding and video editing.
3003,5,Nice product
3004,5,"Great product, my daughter love it."
3005,5,Best
3006,5,Just wow... Awesome Apple Mackbook. Thank you Flipkart.

3009,5,Worth
3010,5,Mac‚ù§Ô∏è
3011,5,Excellent product ...but don't buy online ....go for stores ..
3012,4,"Couldn't find or get better then this. Wait for sale (offers) and buy it without thinking much if you're looking in this price segment. All features are just confined whether it is performance, speed, weight etc. Go for it."
3013,5,"Genuine product last 2 years I'm using. Thanks, Flipkart"
3014,5,Good
3015,5,"Best to use, work like a smartphone, so light and user friendly"
3016,5,I just love its battery backup. 12 hrs ‚ù§. And on off time is also less. Worth it.
3017,4,good
3018,5,The product is up to the mark and with the best performance in the league. But if you have a job of which require much more of connection and sharing then this will be a fussy for you because this require more task for that.
3019,5,"Product is good but never buy on HDFC EMI‚Äôs option either HDFC or FLIPCART is cheating,Deducted 4 extra EMI‚Äôs and now they are blaming on each other"
3020,5,Macbook air is awesome.
3021,5,"Apple macbook air is awesome if you are College student or you are doing some kind professional stuff but not useful for account professional because many account software run in window operating system's like tally not working in mac,Dsc not working in mac in india many thing required window operating system so before you buy it just go through these stuff."
3022,5,It's a fantastic laptop I have ever seen. I just love it.
3023,5,Best
3024,5,Superb Performance... As always Mac
3025,5,Very good...it is mind-blowing
3026,5,Go for it if you're looking for a laptop for day to day task
3027,5,I felt battery support is not good. Rest all is very good.
3028,1,It has not been a year I bought the product. But the sound stopped working one day. Few days after the charger stopped working. The performance was good but not sure what is wrong with the hardware. But it's a big dissapointment.
3029,5,Good
3030,5,It‚Äôs simply best feeling to use apple products . U could find the laptop distinct and variable from other laptop brands . Overall excited using the laptop every day .
3031,5,Rating this after 10 months. Bought for 64000rs. Delivery: Before time & perfect packaging. Software installation: They never force installation. Speed: Perfect speed as can be hoped from someone to obey the inputs. Battery life: 8-9+ hours after continuos surfing using wifi. As I had to do surfing most of the time. Sound quality: Speakers be like-find me if you can..As they are beneath the keyboard and provide perfect quality more than enough someone can hope for from this tiny piece of meta...
3032,5,Great product. Just loving it.
3033,5,Nice
3034,5,Go for it giving this revoew after 2 months .. very light weight.. once u will start using ig. U will know why apple.. üòÇüòÇ
3035,1,The worst product I have purchased in my life. Mother board corrupted in less than 2 years. I had to replace it for 20k. This is worst than a Chinese product. They are looting u on the basis of name only. It's better to buy HP product. Atleast they cost less and work fine for years.
3036,3,Quite good but you can get better specifications laptop in the same price.
3037,4,"After 10 Days of use,  Battery - screen time is around 6to7 hours. This is a concern.  OS updated from the mentioned to different.  Hope rest is well..... I will need some more time to detail more."
3038,5,sometimes the speakers are not working
3039,5,Overall its good but gets too overheated. Fan sound is very loud. Unexpected.
3040,5,Best for coders just loved the trackpad and the stability screen is not a problem if u are stopped by the screen the go for it its not the problem!!
3041,4,"It is a nice product, i did not notice any issues as of now"
3042,1,I bought it in 2018 but now not working at all. use other app(Amazon) for buying
3043,5,Very good
3044,5,Good Product.
3045,3,"Had purchased it in January and was working well for four months. The physical condition was good after a few months of usage. But suddenly it stopped booting properly, showed battery and heating issues. Tried resolving the issue by doing smc reset but it didn't work. Got a diagnosis done from one of the service centers and the problem was with its main board. Just four months of use and there were problems already!"
3046,5,Beautiful
3047,5,"Best laptop ever, class design, it is sleek and thin. It has fastest OS in the world. It is not just a laptop,but it is an experience."
3048,5,Bought MacBook air 2 years back. Working fine.Love it's sleek design
3049,1,My Macbook Air Camera is very bad. I think my laptop camera is changed by seller.
3050,4,Serial number in tax invoice and actual serial number are different. Having issue to register its warranty.  Rest everything is good.
3051,4,The laptop is beautifully designed and slick. The UI is very comfortable but the apple environment is still growing so there can be interoperability issues with other windows programs. Recently however I have been facing quality issues and had to pay to change the keyboard. With upgrade to Catalin now am facing wi fi issues. The policy of replacing parts makes maintenance very high. For the premium price we are paying I expected far better quality. So weigh the pros and cons before buying the...

3094,4,"Best quality, worth of money."
3095,5,A wonderful product.
3096,5,"Nice strong build, unlike the pro model.Only con is there is no in-built HDMI port. I think this is the last model where the apple logo shines."
3097,5,Battery backup and performance makes me happy
3098,5,Still the best laptop if we overlook the big bezzle'e and screen quality. For getting in the Apple Kingdom its the best you can get.
3099,3,"It won‚Äôt turn on after three years from purchase date! Unfortunately, I woke up to start working and finding my MacBook Air not starting. Tried all key combination- started after a couple of hours. But next day onwards- totally conked off. Battery is okay. It‚Äôs basically a three year investment. But performed very well ! Very sad about this."
3100,1,The laptop faced numerous issues 1. Blickering of the screen while watching videos 2. The RAM stopped working within 3.5 months
3101,5,Great laptop even in 2020
3102,5,"Pros: Great for regular use,outstanding battery life, rapid charge, keyboard is smooth, trackpad is smooth, built in 128GB SSD is worth it if you are looking for long term work performance. For 66k, I would really recommend the Air. I have installed Anaconda on it and seems there has been no issue with the background code processing so far. Sound quality is very nice, placement of the speakers really does the trick.  Cons: Power adapter and bottom vent gets heated up very much"

3226,4,I bought this Laptop on Jan 2020. After 1 month of usage I feel everything is fine except the fonts.The fonts are blurry and pixeleted.After trying many methods i upgraded to Catalina but it did not resolve the issues.Looks like it's an issue with Mojave and Catalina for non-retina display.
3227,5,From 2013 I am using only Lenovo series laptop booted with Linux. Needed a new laptop so opted for this. very surprised with the smoothness the laptop runs.As for the SSD for more storage you can take a external hard disk. Very good buy

3250,5,what can be better
3251,5,Apple is Awesome As Always. If You Wish To Go Blind üòÄ
3252,5,Overall performance is superb but display is disappointing. If one can manage with inferior display quality than it is a must go laptop at 50k range.
3253,5,"fits well for the price. The quality is hands down amazing. If you carry your laptop a lot, this is a lifesaver. For the purpose of video editing as well, fits perfect!"
3254,4,No worry if You are a professional otherwise it might be little fuzzy but overall only of its kind
3255,5,Value for money.

3846,2,best performance good quality
3847,4,Display panel in this laptop is quiet outmode with 1400x900 pixel panel in the HD bezzelless and 1080 pixel panels. Another con is the hard drive is formatted in fat encryption which makes it a cumbersome task to transfer files from your mac book to other storage devices be it pendrive hard disk etc unless they too are encrypted in fat format. The processing speed is quiet fast battery back up is excellent. Hard disk read and write speed is awesome. The laptop is compact and sleek easy to carry.
3848,5,Awesome product...
3849,5,High performance laptop
3850,5,Macbook Air is working fine.
3851,5,"Please do not purchase any laptop from here. I purchased a MacBook. The serial number is registered in apple the website, 3 months before. And The major problem is they are not mentioning the laptop serial number in the invoice by which you can not avail any service."

3980,5,Tnx
3981,5,It‚Äôs the best MacBook to buy and for ‚Çπ45000 without exchange during big billion days it was a steal because the new one is unnecessarily expensive. Flipkart did a good job and the product I received was brand new without any speculation.

5069,5,I have just received the laptop today and am very excited to use it.Must say that at this price range it's one of the best laptops to buy without thinking once.Must buy if you want a decent work laptop with good specifications at this price range.

5075,1,Its my review after used after 5 months. Its not a valuable laptop for study or any smooth working purposes. Issues: 1. Connectivity issues I m facing now. Specially usb port. 2. Battary performance was well for first 3 months. After it drains quickly without any playing video or audio. Only pdf reading it running hardly 2 hrs. 3. web camera is very bad performing like 0.3mp. 4. The processor also very slow and sometimes its hanging that one can't move for other work. 5. In sunlight one ...
5076,3,"Just an okay product.. Its a month now and these are my feedback. Performance is okay for people use to surf and watch films. Quality is average.. tapping on mouse pad is like tapping on cardboards. I expected a bit more quality. Few irritants are no capslock light.. u have no idea if the caps is on or not, especially when u type passwords.. other one is the on/off button.. this is just like another key on keyboard without light again.. if the screen lits up only then u could realise the syst..."

5078,5,Laptop is good for kids ..school or secondary laptop for movies and also for older folks who just need connectivity.. like skype and social. For 17k this is a good deal. 1TB for storage and 4GB ram does the light lifting. Dont expect this to do any fancy gaming or programs..what you pay and the purpose is key before selecting this laptop
5079,4,"Very Good in Display Quality. keyboard /Mouse Good. Processing is something , just something slow....but its good.. Over All I found this A Great Office work Laptop , so that i want. 5 mein se phir bi 4.5 dunga.."
5080,1,The webcam quality for video calls is very bad And it takes aloot of time to open each file or folder And the display quality is not good. For basic kids use only . only look wise its good Don't buy better add little more money and buy i3/i5
5081,1,Overall below average laptop not worth buyin nothing noteworthy pretty much not worth the money Ps: not recommended to buy only if u can custom install and remove the stock parts
5082,4,"overall good... value for the price ...but not for heavy works .. it's ok for basic works like web browsing, emails, office works - excell, word etc."

5084,5,Best laptop in given prize range..battery was gud but processor running slow..overall laptop was good for simple works
5085,5,1. Delivery was sooo fast.... Thanks a lot for that. Seller and Ekart.  2. Design- Good and weight also perfect for carrying.  Keypad color is not adjusted as per the product color. It is very problematic to use. No capslock indicator as well as numlock indicator. All USB ports are in one side.  3. Screen - Very good. It's carefully for eye. Very soft looking. Display quality is very good.  5. Performance- Good. Little bit slow to open excel those are greater than 1mb.  6. Battery - Not good...

5109,1,The laptop wont start when received. Flipkart has some misleading claims as now they say that replacement will be done only after Asus technician visits and checks the laptop. So one will end up wasting time and will have to deal with unnecessary haggling for no fault except buying a lemon product from Flipkart. Pathetic fine prints policy.

5132,5,Good laptop
5133,3,"Overall I would grade it 3/5. Display colours are very dim may be because of anti glaze screen. Storage is pitiable.... even my 7 years old Lenovo has got better storage than it. And the worst thing is that I received the product with two minor dead pixels' line at the bottom, these pixels are visible in the pic just above the logo ...... going to opt for the replacement......."

5196,1,Late delivery of a crucial product ! Caps lock key doesn't even have a light to indicate if it's on unless we type and find it out! Neither invoice nor guarantee card provided. Slow performance and average battery life.
5197,1,Do not buy this..you will feel it is value for money but you do not get anything. The speed and performance is horrible. You cannot even open 2 tabs at a time. I tried to increase RAM but cannot do it as it has 4 GB inbuilt RAM and you can only add SSD which is costly. They lied that you can increase the RAM by 16 GB but you cannot
5198,1,Laptop is not turned on after 20 usage and waste of money. ASUS support team is too lazy and no response from them
5199,2,Not upto that i want and i think so much slow processor don't buy please if you have budget then only purchase another lap top don't purchase this one with low budget

5477,1,I have been most unlucky to book this trusting Asus over Acer and others. I was fascinated by the configuration and the comments out here but that's just marketing stunt. Felt deeply sorry for my cousin for whom I booked this. 1. CD/DVD Rom makes hell lot of noise. 2. Booting time is more than 15 mins. 3. The speed of clicking any button is sluggish. 4. This is sick laptop even for office use.

6265,4,"Good laptop for the money. Windows is unusable for me with default configuration (HDD, 4Gb ram). Upgrade ram as soon as you get it for better performance on dual channel memory. There is one empty ram slot and Lenovo manual says upto 12Gb total ram is supported. That is 8 GB ram can be installed in the slot. I've only added 4g. Please remember that 2Gb will be dedicated to the GPU and there's no option in bios to change this. So I had only 6Gb available ram for programs and services. It has o..."

6269,3,"So the very first thing is 4gb ram which is way too low to do anything on this stylish and slim laptop. But thankfully it comes with an empty slot for the same. I had to buy kingston ddr4 8gb 2666mhz ram for Rs.2500 to actually get this laptop to work as otherwise it would utilize 80-85% ram on just opening a web browser. 8gb is the maximum additional upgrade allowed. You can buy 2400mhz or 2666mhz. Apart from that, you get original windows and ms office at this price! Antiglare screen is goo..."
6270,3,First of all I got this gadget in a very low price which was a cool deal with this specifications. No doubt specs are too good but here are some pros and cons after usage of two weeks approx.  Pros:  Design is really good and keys are smooth  Storage is also good  RAM  Genuine windows 10  Genuine microsoft office  AMD ryzen 3 processor  Light weight  Big display  Sound quality is crisp at a defined point  Battery charging time is almost 3 to 3.5 hours from 0 to 100  AMD enabled radeon graphic...
6271,4,Got this laptop in 24000 only . Best laptop For personal nd simple work . But If you want to do heavy work then you should buy SSD RAM variant for fast performance. Which having cost of 28000 I think . Overall good laptop Battery backup is 2-2.5 hours if you continuously use it.
6272,5,It's a great laptop I got it under 29k best buy for me and just add 4gb ram to it and see the magic happen it's too good
6273,4,"Product is worth five stars for the price of 22k-24k. Though I bought this @29k during lockdown since my old laptop crashed. If you can wait for the price drop to 22k-24k, go for this without any second thought. But for the price of @29k, i would recommend to go for ASUS having same specs but much better battery backup.  Pros: 1. Design is good, display is good. 2. Ryzen 3 is much better compared to i3 7th gen. 3. Comes with MS office 4. Speakers are good.  Cons: 1. Mouse touch pad is n..."
6274,4,"I am using this laptop since 1year. No complaints. Running perfectly. But it is little bit slow response. It's because the storage device is hdd which has slow read rate. When I upgraded to ssd and 8GB ram , it is performance beast. It is also capable of running games in medium settings. Overall I will four star. Acer aspire 7 is more better than this. If we considering the budget. It is the best laptop"
6275,5,"I think this is one of the finest laptop i ever bought Looks good , best battery backup, performance is very fast with ryzen 3 dual core, Ryzen 3 dual core is far better than Intel i5 10th gen It will give u battery backup of around 5 hrs Go for it guys"
6276,4,"I'm gong to brief about the Pros and Cons only.  Pros - 1. Ryzen 3 Processor 2. AMD Vega 3 Graphics 3. FHD Screen 4. Light weight 5. Windows 10 and MsOffice pre installed 6. Looks  Cons - 1. Battery backup 2. TouchPad 3. Webcam  Now on a simple note for day to day office work or students assignments, surfing its a great deal. If you are thinking of gaming then don't go for it. Else product is good."
6277,4,I SO HAPPY THIS IS MY FIRST LAPTOP THANKS FLIPKART GIVE ME FAST DELIVERY AND GOOD SERVICE THERE IS NO FRAUD FROM FLIPKART YOU CAN TRUST THE FLIPKART
6278,5,"Build Quality is Not so Good, Track-pad is decent enough for daily use. Performance is good considering the price Thanks to Ryzen 3 3200U (Recommend to buy Variant with Ryzen 3 4000 series). Main bottleneck for this laptop is the HDD. Because of hard disk this laptop doesn't feel snappy(AMD is not to be blamed). I recommend Upgrading to SSD or buy a variant with SSD. Display is very good with decent viewing angles. 4 Hours + battery life with fast charging."
6279,4,"Honest Review  I am writing this review after using this laptop for almost 2 months. Overall quality is average unless you have upgraded RAM. I an waiting to purchase an 8GB RAM because RAM consumption is too much by the Windows App, 600MB is reserved by hardware as well. I haven't used any SSD powered laptop so I can't say buying it will speed up your performance or not but am sure with the RAM.  So when I play game (GTA IV) on this laptop. CPU usage is always around 30%-40% RAM usage is a..."
6280,4,It's really. Value for money. Performance wise it's good. Not to expect quick boot and fast multi tasking. But it's quite ok for daily single task activities. Laptop is not much sturdy. Noisy keyboard and noisy mouse pad. Probe to Scratch. 180 degree display is very supportive and still not giving confident not over usage. Though these are all not in harsh note. It's overall good product in this price point.
6281,5,"A good laptop in the price segment . Dont exoect it to run heavy gaming or work, it's good to go for moderate users like bwosing studying and work."
6282,5,Overall a good product for this price!! Display is good. Battery backup is around 4 hours. Speaker clarity is awesome.... But not more loud. Performance is better than i3 7th gen processor. Ram upgrade is must for improving the speed of the machine.
6283,5,"A really good product considering that it's so affordable, I recommend it to anyone who needs it for basic tasks like surfing, typing, school and office work in general. However, I would recommend that you upgrade the RAM a 4GB upgrade would be ok, but I recommend adding another 8GB as a lot of it is taken by background processes (I was even able to play GTA V with the 8GB upgrade) The only little problem I have aside that is the display is a little off coloured."
6284,3,"good laptop at reasonable prices .charger size is small, but speed is not up to the mark. ok for basic college work"
6285,4,Got this 1 in offer by flipkart big billion days for just 2500....many suggestions i received in terms of low budget laptop..but i wanted to try this product...but this has led me so far aftr months of usage..it comes with great display atleast compared to other brands in this range...but rest all depends upon the user how he manages his pc. but to me its little slow in terms of opening an application but its fine manageable...overall its the most decent 1 i came accrossin this price range.
6286,3,Worked fine till 6-7 months after that started lagging. Very slow performance. Battery backup is just 2 hours. Low end pc. Motherboard got damaged in just 11 months. The new motherboard replaced by lenovo is not working properly. I think it's not good for heavy usage. The laptop is not as good as expected.
6287,5,It's awesome laptop doing great work when u creat account first time it's take time after that it's works excellent and battery is average and I get in 25k on big billion days and it's work smoothly
6288,3,first of all battery backup is not good design is good webcam is totally poor quality low grade plastic is used so build quality is zero performance is also not so good it takes approx 40_50 seconds to boot after installing all the drivers instead go for acer aspire ryzen 3 with better build quality and performance
6289,3,"This one is good if you are looking for general usage. Ram need to be extended for better performance. Camera should be enhanced more , currently it is poor. Other than this is ok for a student."
6290,5,"It's not the best laptop I've ever used but it's certainly the best bang for buck at this price. I invested some more into the laptop (added 8gb ram, replaced hdd with ssd) and the performance shot through the roof!  I have two issues though - the display chassis is a little too flimsy (wasn't expecting much at this price anyway), and the display itself is sub-par. I had to calibrate it manually to make it bearable but all's well if ends well.  In short, you can't get anything better at this..."
6291,4,This is my first ever purchase of laptop. I am using it for last 6 months and after that I'm reviewing the product. 1. The battery performance is medium. In power saving mode the performance is better. Upto 4 to 4.5 hours. 2. The screen sometimes become grey so clarity is medium. 3. Dolby sound system is very good. 4. The touch pad system is not upto the mark. It's better to use a mouse. 5. The build quality is also good in this price. 6. For better performance you just need to upgrade the R...
6292,5,"This is not a student laptop, but I would like to say it's also for professionals.  I can perform following things very smoothly:  Web development with .net framework Adobe Photoshop Android development Multitasking Smooth video editing like filmora AutoCAD MATLAB. Etc YouTube professionals work    Below are the issues In short it is not a software developer or engineers laptop. Better you look for i7 + 16 GB ram with 500ssd  -one more thing Ryzen 3 is best as compare to i3 for sure."
6293,5,Laptop is very good performance is very good and battery performance is also nice and charging is 65 word which charge the laptop at very low time performance is super at this the price point
6294,3,Lenovo is preloaded with default apps which makes the performance slow. Better to disable all those apps not to run on the start up to improve performance. Even I was literally feeling like returning but being an engineer thought give few more days.. suggest Lenovo team also to reduce the preloaded apps or send the technician who comes and does the first time installation and set up. This might be useful for common man  Lookwise it is awesome 500+ mb is dedicated to for display So we get 3.5 ...
6295,4,"Perfect home laptop. Good graphics. And appealing outlook. 15.1inch. and compact and wonderfull. It doesn't have the CD slot. The only disadvantage I found.  Apart from that's this is good with, teams, photoshop, Adobe premiere etc. Its awesome for those type of softwares. And its like good enaf."
6296,4,"Got it for 24k, good for the mentioned price, don't go for it above 25k, good thing is it can be extended ram and SSD, display is decent and viewing angle is not upto the mark."
6297,3,"Well, using it for several days and it never disappointed me so far. I was a little bit confused about AMD but then found Ryzen 3 3200U is actually better than Intel's i3 8th gen and it can compete even 10th gen in terms of clock speed.  Looks like one must update RAM since it's 4gb isn't enough for multitasking cause it's Slow and Sometimes hangs. And for further betterment one can go for SSDs(NVMe only otherwise replace the HDD)  Display is quite decent in comparison (in that price segment)..."
6298,4,Pro Decent product and built quality compared to price of laptop. Two side bezel definitely look good. R3 is great for light work ideal for office work which doesn't involve heavy software. Most importantly it is cheaper than I3. Keypad is great and button quality and finish is goods Preinstalled Windows and MS office greatly reduce your installation hassle and makes it perfect for non-tech users.  Cons It made in China. Though it has a Graphic card it is not a gaming laptop. Screen is brigh...

6300,4,"This is a must buy laptop if you wish to get a laptop in 30k as it includes graphics too If you wish to get a laptop for normal use it is the best laptop don't go for a second think to buy this , the display and the features are ausumn  One thing you need to keep in mind is the battery it last for 2, 3 hours on heavy usage. It sometimes hangs but after updates the laptop is working fine (it's an honest review)   I am Giving the review after using the laptop for a month"
6301,4,Laptop is Best in 27K but 4Gb Ram is not Sufficient if you are a casual user then buy it other Wise its waste of money not recommended for Gaming or Editing
6302,4,I bought this laptop in big billion day sale. It has only 4gb ram. Better to upgrade extra 4gb. After adding extra ram it's work like charm. Battery backup is not that much good. But at this price what you expect. Sound quality is very low after enabling Dolby audio. If your budget is between 25k to 34k definitely buy this one . MS OFFICE is with life time validity. And McAfee Antivirus with 1 month of trial version
6303,4,"This laptop is good for a student like working in ms excel,word,powerpoint and editing and checking email.this laptop only comes in 4gb ram whch is soldered to the motherboard so u can grab another 8gb of ram from flipkart so u can make it much more powerful but not good as expected."
6304,5,"Excellent product. Early delivery by Flipkart. Good packing. No issue in operation of machine. No issue in activating preinstalled Windows 10 and MS Office 2019. Mcphy antivirus was preinstalled aswell. Overall a good purchase in INR 24490 including one year warranty.

6305,5,"The laptop is very good in terms of daily office work and study, Do not expect it to out perform the specs. It is a decent laptop which will give you enough to get going. But if you want high speeds and extreme multi tasking, then go for a better one. If Study and office work( Spreadsheets, multiple chrome windows, drive etc.) is your concern then its just fine."

6308,5,I purchased it for my younger one. Performance is pretty good and I like the way it is slim and handy at this price range.  Recommended product.!
6309,3,"The feel and design is pretty sleek and its genuinely light weighted. Battery performance is average but its good for office work &/or for Work from Home purpose. Biggest down side is that the speakers in this laptop is very low. Ryzen 3 vs Intel 3 was a challenge but if you are saving 2-3K with Ryzen, go for it. Overall satisfied with the product."

6333,5,Amazing product.
6334,1,The laptop is average...what's really disappointing is the display...when put on full brightness it still cannot make things bright....bad viewing experience.
6335,5,"I have purchased this laptop on 26.06.2020 , it is very smooth to handle , games can be played , Perfect laptop for daily use I have purchased it for 24990 , Finally you can go for it undoubtedly"
6336,4,"less than decent battery backup (less than 2.5 hrs), other aspects appear ok (used for about one month till date, mainly zoom meetings), sound from in-built speakers could have been louder"
6337,1,"very bad , it hang always ,cant browse even email"
6338,1,"Literally struggling from past two days, this laptop is getting me sick. Boot time is almost 5+ minutes and windows tiles freeze when executed app search. Cortona üôè pathetic with this low end machines. YOU SHOULD ORDER RAM ASAP WITH THIS LAPTOP, ELSE YOU SHOULD HAVE A PATIENCE LIKE MONK TO WORK WITH THIS. üôè  If I open any application, it takes 25-30 seconds to appear/prompt.

6339,1,Don't Buy.. Very Slow..
6340,1,"Here is my honest review after using this laptop for 6 months(I belong to a technical background)- Extremely disappointed with Leveno. I am regretting after buying this laptop. I hardly had any expectation with this laptop, still I am utterly disappointed. Their technical support team (on phone) is very incompetent and inefficient and unable to understand/resolve my issues on call. The issues I have been facing from day 1: 1. Fan does not work and hence the laptop is heating too much. 2. Blu..."
6341,1,Bad laptop.....lots of problems......it is not good as shown on paper.....not recommended at all.....
6342,4,Good at this price range. Without thinking just go for it..
6343,1,"Very slow, Battery is not good. Drains very fast"
6344,5,"Nice laptop, smooth performance , all should go for it üòÄ"
6345,5,Best in this price range
6346,3,It is good but it is slow
6347,3,antivirus show for one year but given only 1 month .
6348,5,Superb u should go for it.....without any doubt!
6349,5,simply outstanding......top class performances
6350,1,Very very slow... Fully disappointed plz don't buy. My all money is wasted
6351,5,If you have budget of 30k then go for it.
6352,4,It just a awesome laptop in budget range It good for students and for daily work ...üòçüòçüòçüòç
6353,3,Battery backup is low. Sound is not good. Performance is OK
6354,5,Laptop is good but it hangs sometimes. Laptop taskbar comes delay in screen
6355,3,Ok.
6356,1,horrible.stopped working within 3 days.
6357,2,I purchased this product 5 days before.very worst experience...bad battery life..I requested for return the product
6358,4,"Everything's are good, only the length of the charger is very short."
6359,3,"This is a nice budget laptop and looks premium.. But the problem is the battery, if you will upgrade it with better SSD and ram it will give you decent performance. it supports m.2 nvme..."
6360,5,"Design in this range is awesome. Performance is also good for normal work for students. One problem : fan is noisy , now i feel i have to two fan in room one ceiling fan another laptops fan."
6361,4,"Overall Laptop is good under 25 thousand but the problem is with its battery its battery life is upto 3 hrs maximum for normal use battery is not upto the mark and ryzen 3 processor is good for normal use, although it has FHD display but its viewing angle is not good... Main problem is with its battery lenovo should improve it..."
6362,5,nice product
6363,5,awesome look by lenovo and very fast delivery by flipcart it's loveing
6364,2,my touchpad is not working how to fix it
6365,3,"Display sucks, poor viewing angles, backlight burns through the panel  Battery life is under 4 hours  Otherwise great, Disable antivirus and update windows for faster experience, ram upgrade recommend"
6366,2,After 2 month uses it slow.googl app hi 5 se 10 minute mein open hota hai.
6367,4,Best one to this price (23k) the main dispointment was ram its only 4gb. Due to this less ram performance get little bit lower
6368,1,The battery even after charging 100% does not stay for even for 35mins.
6369,5,"Worthy purchase even in 28k. All-rounder performance. Added extra 4GB DDR4 2400 RAM + NVMe m2 128 GB SSD. Now it loads four times faster than out of the box speed. Recommends for students , programmers and media streamers. Yet it plays most of the games having mid range graphics, not recommends for gaming or studio editing purposes."
6370,3,The laptop if using for multitasking without gaming then it needs to upgraded with SSD/RAM.  Else it will take few minutes to open applications and multitasking is very difficult especially if you are online and presenting.
6371,4,A decent laptop for the money you paid üëçüëç
6372,5,Overall good performance no hanging issue sleek slim light small as per latest laptops comes in this price good with lenovo brand I use lenovo 9-8 years lenovo I have face no issue yeah price is fluctuated but good under 26-27k price
6373,4,Amazing laptop under 25k . Display is awesome. Performance good. Battery average. Overall a good package under rs 25k...
6374,5,It is to good product but one problem is there its battery backap is poor
6375,3,Average laptop. Don't expect it to be decent quick. Opens up applications after more than 30 secs. Would not recommend it for heavy or moderate use.
6376,4,A best laptop at this range... It is very stylishly designed..... Display is good.... Amd ryzen 3 and 8th gen Mcafee is free for one month but they have mentioned 1 year..... Defects are: A cheap quality battery Battery life is tooo low.... Sound quality is bad..... They have mentioned dolby audio but it's tooooo low.... Camera quality poooor.. üò¨ Except this it's the.... Best.... Don't worry just buy it‚ù§üòç
6377,5,Just Upgrade RAM To 8gb and see the performance!!! Budget Gaming!!!
6378,2,Performance is very poor. The newest laptop hangs so badly
6379,2,One of the worst laptops I have seen. It doesnt give the performance of Ryzen 3 processor. It is running far too slow than expected. Dont ever buy this laptop never look at 3.9 rating. Only way to make this laptop work good is to upgrade the RAM. Also the battery is too low. Power only lasts for 2.5 hours. This review is given after first time use. Also disk usage shows 10% in a brand new laptop.
6380,2,Very slow..if you open anything it takes lots of time to open...but other than that it's good...sound is very less..picture quality is nice.. although it's not up to the mark..next time if I buy laptop I'll definitely go for intel processor...AMD is worst
6381,5,Fabulous design with great keypad and touchpad
6382,2,"Very slow processing,less battery backup Don't go with this laptop if u want to do heavy tasking. It takes time to even open Google Chrome."
6383,1,Simply waste
6384,5,"This is best under budget and value for money , for better speed increase the RAM since it's only 4 gb"
6385,3,Laptop is slow but if you are going for this consider upgrading RAM to 8 or 12 gb else go for 4gb 256 ssd or 8gb 1tb hdd. After upgrade it works like a charm.
6386,5,Best in the segment....strong build quality even it is plastic made.....4 gb ram a bit sluggish because amd processor is damn good for it to use resources but chrome is a Ram- hungry devil ... Replace chrome with opera and install 8 gb of 2400 Mhz ram from crucial.....install additional ram will boost it ....go for it..if u want premium looks and best performance üòçüòç
6387,3,"Ifter 5 days of use .... Taking time to boot up , performance is ok ok , rest all good ...."
6388,3,Only design is good in this laptop others things are worst the performance is very slow its taking too much time to open apps and it is hanging too much .and battery is also dropping very fast. I got very bad experience in this laptop.this is not value for money.
6389,4,"Good Entry Level laptop for everyday use. Just one suggestion, go for 8 gb Ram...or upgrade it later."
6390,4,Everything is fine. Note - need a ram (must) and ssd(optional) to work otherwise it's slow and also release heat.
6391,4,McAfee comes with 30 days subscription so I'm very sad
6392,5,Go for it.
6393,5,Good
6394,5,Nice
6395,4,Nice
6396,5,Osome product
6397,5,Nice
6398,4,Good laptop in this budget...
6399,5,Awesome
6400,1,"Value for Money, Pros: No heating problem, Low cost, Light weight, looks attractive, pre installed Office home student edition, 1 year unlimited device antivirus protection.  Cons: Slow, cant run heavy processes, no gamming please. Slow speed can be overcome to some extent by adding 8 GB Ram  re-rated to 1* Reason - Head phone jack loose connection is not covered under warranty plus service centre lacks staff who can fix it."
6401,3,Little bit slower but value for money
6402,4,Very nice performance. Should buy....üëåüèº
6403,2,It hangs anytime....and shut down.... processer is slow

6407,4,Camera is worst but laptop is best for all type of use
6408,3,Average performance. Poor battery charge. Good laptop for light work.
6409,5,Worth for price !
6410,2,Everything is good.. except its hanging problem... It hangs a lot... Sometimes its very irritating while working on it... I don't know what's wrong....
6411,5,Good
6412,5,Nice product
6413,3,It's an average product.. In this price range I would also suggest to see other alternatives.. Battery backup is less Display is good It lags in between We have to increase the RAM for better performance No slot for LAN cable No USB slot in right of the laptop.. slots are in left side Cursor button pad is bit stiff.
6414,4,Best buy for this budget
6415,5,My use is only for drafting I use only ms office For me it's good.
6416,3,Ok product
6417,4,"With this price it is better then others, look and color are really good."
6418,5,It's great in this price (26000)
6419,5,"I m using from past 2 months, and must say this is the best laptop under 30k. Very useful for students and people working from home. I felt a problem of low display, otherwise the laptop is best in this range."

6428,5,Good time delivery....
6429,1,"I bought this laptop after seeing its features and thought that it is a good laptop in a low budget. But that was my mistake. Bad things: sound is very low (speakers are not that good). The system is extremely slow, it takes a very long time to start. It started to hang within 1 month (even I didn't installed any other software or game in it). The speed of system is very very slow. Even to see photographs or to transfer files in other folders it takes a lot of time. Good things: FHD, design i..."

6440,3,Ok
6441,4,"BEWARE!!!: MS office is only trial version of 7 days. When you ask about this with seller, they directly initiate returning of laptop. Crazy way of customer support.  But the laptop is awesome. For the price it's awesome. I upgraded it with 4GB additional RAM and 3 years Kaspersky Antivirus. Now it's one rocking machine...  I actually bought 2 laptops . One for sis and another one for dad. Because i liked it so much."
6442,3,"Design is good , battery life also not bad approx 4 hours or max (on normal working ) , performance is not really speed but in this range good"

6468,2,"Sluggish performance, not at all good display. Poor sound quality and poor camera. Even if only Chrome is open, it would not be possible to open another application quickly. Not sure how come so many people rated it so high. It has only given me more stress than any delight of buying a new product.  Flipkart accepted to pick up the product and issue refund. I think they would have repacked and sold it to someone else and because of which the other person would have also gone through the same..."
6469,2,"I just use this product only 2 days. previously i used Hp intel pentium gold, since i used my old laptop 7 year's. and i feel more comfortable also have good battery back up. come to lenovo its take time to reboot the app's. also worst battery max 2.5- 3 yrs depend on works. also you cant use multi task at the time. come to processor compared to intel pentium gold, AMD ryzen not yet good. i suggesting in this budget you can get Hp brand laptop."
6470,5,Super laptop NYC look
6471,2,Battery is poor..2hrs maximum..hangs sometimes.. Not recommended. Windows 10 and Ms Office is there. The Design of the lap is good.

6481,2,Device speed is very slow not up to level doesn't worth for price
6482,1,Battery power is low...fan sound is high... don't buy this product
6483,3,It hangs a most while..better to get upgraded ram to 8 g or 12 gb then there could be some hike in performance..
6484,5,Much more better than Intel i3 processor Best budget laptop .......
6485,3,I hate it. Its performance is very slow. It takes too much time open Ms excel. Now think about about the other applications. Think before you purchase this laptop.
6486,2,PC is very slow. Brought based on review from you tube. All are fake a good laptop will cost more. I can't even use smoothy for Normal office work. Any applications take at least 10-15 seconds for opening.
6487,4,Nice Laptop....
6488,1,"Very slow laptop. After a month of using it this is my review; from the time of switching it on to switching it off it takes forever. Generally laptops become slow after using for a significant period of time, but this laptop is slow after a week of basic use of MS Word ONLY!"
6489,4,It's owsome
6490,1,Laptop functioned only for8 months. Never ever buy e-goods thru Flipkart. They won't provide any after sales services. I reported the matter to Flipkart and Lenovo but the matter not cleared even after two weeks.l lost my money.
6491,5,Best of the best performance.....Trust worth and user friendly lapy....
6492,5,This product is not good but it's better !! Fastly hanged problem....& battery is discharge vry fast...so i think it's not good

6495,5,Nice laptop for beginners
6496,1,This laptop is very slow working. It taking 3 minutes for starting window. And after start its work Very slow. My money waste for this laptop. I never suggest to any one for buy this laptop.

6506,3,Works very slow
6507,5,Nice!!!!! Good Budget Laptop.........Highly Recommended
6508,3,I am writing this Review after using this product after 1 & half month. I purchased this product for my wife which she is currently using for her office work. Good thing about this laptop is it has good screen and performance is also good. Keyboard has number which is again a useful feature for working person. Only thing which flipkart promised & was not fulfilled was it will come with 1 year mcafee antivirus protection it got expired in one month.
6509,1,"Not at all worth the money, it is very slow. If you try to open two apps together it will not perform the task well and get hanged. Battery backup is also not at all good, max three hours backup I am getting with this new laptop."
6510,4,Best laptop under budget i am using more than 2 months I would suggest u to buy this under an average price
6511,4,"Good, but bit slow."

6519,1,"Extremely slow and pathetic laptop. It takes forever to start this laptop. I recorded the lag time for opening applications and was surprised to see how come a laptop be this slow in current times. My 1998 PC is faster than this junk.

This is when I have not installed any other application apart from whatever comes packaged ..."

6521,1,System is very very slow and laggy.. dont go fo this.
6522,3,"The laptop is very slow and gets stuck a lot but...you can get rid of that problem if you increase the Random Access Memory. In the beginning my laptop was performing extremely slow. Then I added 8GB of the memory (Crucial Brand) and after that the performance improved significantly. 4GB of the memory is inbuilt, so if you add 8GB of that, the memory will become 12GB, which is enough for even gaming. Ryzen 3 processor is nice. So without the increased memory, the Laptop is trash but after you..."
6523,4,Good
6524,5,Very nice product
6525,1,I have brought this a month ago But its showing is warranty period already used 6 of month. And i only got 6 month of remaining period. Online its a scam please dont buy online also not all are genuine parts. Please dont buy online

6527,1,It hangs a lot don't buy
6528,2,It's processor is not good
6529,4,All I can say it's good but it is laggy and sometimes you may have to power off.I have bought it recently and although good but speakers have less volume. Camera quality good and battery is although not very good just fine and value for money and it is good option to buy. In budget range it is good to have and a good option.
6530,2,"Very slow, bought it for my son for his online class... Its very slow normally his class start 8.45 am..He need to open system by 8.30 am...then only he will be able to attend class in Time...Its a basic laptop..if your are looking for gaming or planning to do something which need performance it will be wrong choice"

6623,4,Value product but you need to install ssd for better performance
6624,3,"After lot of research, I have bought it but the performance is not good, and it takes time to start up. Even sometimes when open a new tab its keep rolling up. The design looks fine."

6629,1,Dont buy this laptop
6630,4,Battery drain in about 3 to 4 hours other wise everything is ok
6631,1,Not so good it started hanging after only 10-12 days of usage.
6632,2,It is started hanging problem from very second use of it
6633,4,"Everything is good till now Battery could be better And The max briteness is not up to the need , it feels low when sunlight comes, could be 2 or 3 point more Else good One more complain why the hell price suddenly decreases from 30990 to 28990 after placing the order, it's unfair"

6638,2,"Not satisfied,,,"
6639,1,Hanging problem
6640,3,Better to buy laptop with 8 gb ram. Display is good. Performance slow with 4 gb ram.
6641,1,"Lot of noise was coming from fan+cpu assembly of laptop. So I have returned it. Also had issues with battery, only 2.5 hrs time with battery. Heating issues were also there."
6642,4,Very slow
6643,1,Veru slow laptop dont buy it !!!!!
6644,3,Very slow
6645,3,Cheap and best. Home and Student purpose ok.
6646,4,It does its job and is a good budget laptop but do keep in mind that it is not meant for gaming and adding extra 8gb RAM (as i did) gives much more stable perfomance.... I got it for 25k for that price its absolutely great!
6647,3,It's getting fan sound heavy
6648,5,Nice product
6649,1,Worst performance
6650,4,Good.......
6651,4,Only problem is battery drain fastly. Otherwise best product. Worth buying at this price
6652,3,"This is a entry level budget laptop and even has a good performance due to the AMD processor, gaming might be twitchy while playing mediocre game but handles every day daily task easily but might be a bit slow while multitasking, overall it is not 5 star but a manageable lap for students and entry level laptop learners I would say"
6653,4,Display and built quality could have been better ... over All ok for that price ...
6654,5,It is good for free fire üî•üî•üî•
6655,1,Poor defect product

6657,5,Nice laptop took for my brother.
6658,2,Perfomance is so bad. I can't even use the mouse properly. Only the design is good
6659,3,Starting it was okay but as days passed its geeting slow. After opening application its doing good. But it lags while opening the application
6660,4,Good laptop for mid range users not good for gaming. But no lag.
6661,3,It is a 'kaam chalau' laptop. Bought it for my Dad. The only thing he doesn't like about it is its trackpad which feels weird and too plasticy so we use a external mouse.
6662,3,Battery down fast..And you can't see the screen cross directions...Only straight you can watch on this.. As per this drawbacks price is very high.dont buy.
6663,5,Using from 2 months no issue occurred till now. Processor are good for this price. If you want to use for your online classes then go for it
6664,1,Worst product.. Huge fan sound within one month. No proper support from flipkart.
6665,3,Dear team no body help me for system installation please help me
6666,5,"Very good Product and features also stylish design, Full HD display etc."

6668,3,Average performance.. Look and feel nice...
6669,1,Very slow and the keyboard is bad and fan sound coming inside overall very bad product Totally irritated by buying this product
6670,4,Awesome project
6671,1,Buy this laptop if you want to regret your life please dont be fooled with the low price it is not worth it Please dont buy and waste your money Very very very poor performance It hangs very badly as soon as you install a software so pls dont buy and waste your money like i did Just worked well for one month then its totally gone i am unable to replace it as the return policy has expired

6675,2,Worst product
6676,1,Very slow and sluggish. Intel laptops are based. Finally sold it out
6677,4,display:4/5 battery:3/5 keyboard:4.5/5 performance:4/5
6678,1,"Battery problem, low speed ,don‚Äôt waste a money"
6679,5,One of the the best product on this price range
6680,4,"It's a Budget Laptop, never expect a Gr8 performance. But a very Student required Performance"
6681,1,Waste of Money
6682,5,THE LAPTOP IS VERY GOOD AND YOU BELIEVE ME BUYER'S IF YOU ARE DECIDING TO BUY A LAPTOP WITHIN A RANGE OF 30K TO 32K YOU CAN EASILY AND WITHOUT THINKING TWICE GO FOR IT.. IT IS VERY BETTER THAN i3 8th generation THANK YOU!!

6687,1,Too much lag I can't use it daily basis waste of money I lost my money but I wanted to save your money so if your bray is in right place so don't buy it
6688,5,"1. Worth the money i spend. I have got in 24 k in big billion sale. 2. Plays 4K video flawlessly. You can imagine the processing power it has. 3. Designed beautifully, looks like it's made of metal body. 4. Adapter wire is short 5. Screen is bright enough and sharp due to 1080p resolution 6. Boot time 20 second, shutdown time 5 second. 7. Battery backup is 3 hrs with movie playing with highest brightness and full volume."
6689,2,"Very bad machine 25k ,,very hangedd +takingvtime to much ,"
6690,4,Not bad
6691,5,Price to Performance ratio is very good. Works like a charm for standard multitasking. Design is a big plus. Looks very elegant and classy. Weight balancing is also pretty good. Battery life is average 4-5 hours. Would suggest everyone to increase the ram to atleast 8GB. Better than Intel i3 7th gen that you might get in this price bracket. A great buy. Satisfied with the product.
6692,5,good one
6693,3,Fast delivery just in 31 days..... Nice product worth @. 25 k
6694,2,"Service post delivery after raising complaints was bad. Multiple follow ups and end result was nothing. Things take time to load even with a blank laptop. Screen part of the laptop has no stability, shakes a lot. You need to press hard on the mouse pad not the smoothest. If bought will need to be upgraded with better RAM."

6705,2,Bettery is not better
6706,1,"Laptop is dead slow I never expected ghis from Lenovo especially, why did they released such an laptop. If we want to upgrade the memory also no info provided in bios regards to speed in MHz.  To those people who want to purchase this one kindly look for Other laptops."

6721,2,I thought it's good laptop but after one day it became very slow I think I need to add more ram and SSD to it in order to use it.
6722,5,Just expect to update the ram to atleast another 4 gb.. Laptop isn't so slow as its own.. But when there's a heavy load it will lag.. You can make this a beast if you can upgrage the ram and ssd.
6723,2,Laptop accha hai but battery is not good
6724,5,It is very useful and the best laptop ever.
6725,3,Not having CD disc drive. I am surprised that laptop is not having disc drive. Hanged once with in week
6726,5,All is well
6727,2,"Laptop is light weight and stylish in design. As per product description on detail page, it comes with lifetime MS office and free one year subscription of McAfee, but in reality the MS office applications are not getting updated and applications are not working as well as the subscription is only a 20 days trial and you have to purchase separate paid subscription of McAfee. Well the delivery system of the product is horrible and got my laptop after whopping 10 days....."

6738,1,"Cost to feature good deal, but quite sometime lags in performance. So overall disappointed. The windows update even can't go smoothly installed on the laptop. very pathetic / poor performance."
6739,4,Nice

6742,5,Amazing product at this priceüòçüòç
6743,5,Dont hesitate before buying it.. True reviews- Battery backup is low If you want to use it heavy upgrade the ram and ssd The 4gb 1 tb varient is pathetic.. But if you upgrade it you will love the performance

6745,5,"Overall product is good. Good Picture quality, Good battery and good performance by processor. But build up quality is not so strong, quality of keypad is not so good, it should be improved. Flipkart customer support is very bad, they only provide assurance, not resolution. I does not get McAfee antivirus 12 month subscription. Today 15 days are going to end of delivery but still not getting Antivirus license key."
6746,5,"Value for money, I upgraded ram to 12 and its performance changed a lot, now i can play games like gta5"

6759,1,Microphone not working...touchpad is loosely fitted...poor build quality...delay flipkart delivery...never buy anything from lenovo...build poorly and in huge amount so the price is so less but it will hardly last for 2 years...batter to go for Asus Vivobook 15 or any higher brands like Dell or hp...if you compromise with quality...you will regret later...spend some more money and go for other brands if you dont want your laptop last for only 1 or 2 years...
6760,3,"Non of the windows drives were up to date, had to upgrade everything and until it was upgarded, MS office wont get installed.  Lags a lot, better to get the RAM upgraded. Not for gamers or heavy users"

6762,4,"One of the best laptops in the market at 26k ,I think I can't get better deal at this price. But the performance of the laptop is average what we can expect in this prise range Other wise it is a complete killer"
6763,5,If you get a DDR4 2400mhz ram it will run fast as lightning and because of dual channel and 2 gb vram it runs games like GTA5 and almost all Big titles in gaming with descent fps on low settings .Check its benchmarks on youtube it runs almost all games descently.
6764,2,Very very very slow.

6766,5,Good deal
6767,5,"I got this laptop at 24240 Rs during sale time.  Design is very nice. Very slim and delicate. Display is full HD with matt finishing, but viewing angle is very poor because of TN display. I personally suggest for 14 inch display. Because in case of 15.6 inch display, screen is lightly swing/tilting with ceiling fan air. Performance is average, it justify price. Not so great. Battery backup is average, depend on usage, with internet it consume more power. Average 4 hour battery backup. But co..."

6811,4,Just bought this laptop.fully satisfied.worth every single penny.only one flaw is battery backup that is quite small.but charging is fast so no concerns. Do not purchase if you are a heavy gamer or want to do too many tasks.overall this laptop is good for students and professionals.go for it if your budget is around 25k to 27k
6812,4,"At this price point this one is very good The problem i faced is about speakers,the sound quality is very poor.better to but a sound bar or any small rated speakers"
6813,3,Good
6814,4,Great laptop for beginners. Might operate slowly due to low ram capacity. Windows 10 is also great
6815,3,"ok not so fast , speaker volume is less i dont where dolby digital has been used , no keyboard light display .very slow opening .opening three apps systems gets stuck."
6816,5,It's good... battery upto 5 hours....design super
6817,4,Everything is good except battery backup... hardly 3 to 4hrs while browsing and 2hrs when zoom call is on. Good thing is it was getting changed with in 1hr 30mins
6818,4,It is best laptop under 40000. If your budget is higher than 40000 then go for other laptops Everything is fine but yellowish didplay
6819,4,"For the price it's an amazing product. A little sluggish at times, perfect for casual usage."
6820,4,Nyc
6821,5,Awesome laptop..
6822,4,"This laptop is pretty good for the price tag it comes with. Got it for 23k in the big billion day sale. the only drawback was the 4 gb ram...these days even phones dont work well with 4 gb ram. i would suggest anyone buying this should also get additional 8 gb ram along with it to make this laptop amazing. The highlight is the design, thin bezels and display..i dont think any other company is giving these specifications in this price range. i am Pretty happy with the purchase as i bought adat..."
6823,5,I have bought it at 25k at that price it is best. Battery life i average when connected to WiFi. And sometimes it lags also.
6824,1,"Error status is shown as ""Hard Disk"" not installed. Disappointed with purchase"
6825,3,Built quality is poor
6826,4,"The RAM should be upgraded else the performance is very slow, after the upgrade it is good"
6827,5,Very good laptop of this price.
6828,4,"Laptop is awesome .. Best laptop under 30k Better go with Amd ryzen 3 instead if Intel core i3 8th gen, Laptop delivered after 8 days of book date ,it's OK bcoz purchased on big billions days , happy with this laptop"
6829,4,Wonderful laptop
6830,3,"Camera is ridiculously bad ..no clarity ..want to understand whether it's the issue with the laptop recieved or its universal with this model ... Keyboard acts funny ..they are actually interchanged so if u want @ u need to press shift and "" to get it instead of shift and 2. ..."
6831,4,"The laptop looked great however the build quality could have been better (plastic body). Got MSO student version with it and one month trial Anti virus. Battery is good but that depends how Im using my laptop. AMD ryzen is a powerful range of processors, let's see how it holds up in future. Digital Dolby sounds great. Fast charging almost takes 90min to full charge from 5%. Decent webcam. Keyboard looks great but without backlit so in dark look hard. But the design looks sweet and slim."
6832,2,After using it for a month now I can say it's too slow even in day to day tasks. I don't know with 4 gb of ram and 1 tb of hard disk how a laptop can work too slow. I also think AMD Ryzen 3 processor performance is not up to the mark it's too slow u must go with intel processors.
6833,5,"Superbb product ,ryzen 3 is better than i3"
6834,3,not bad at this price
6835,5,Nice Look and Video clearly is good
6836,4,Good quality laptop....

6851,5,This product is to much good and thank you flipkart
6852,5,I m Fully Satisfied üî•‚ù§
6853,3,"performance average lit bit slow , display colors not natural and camera is very poor"
6854,5,I think it is best laptop for students.you will get 4 gb ram but you have to upgrade ram to 8 gb for better performance.Otherwise you will get poor performance.battery is about 3-3.5 hours.Display is very good.
6855,5,Very very very super laptop all is good.
6856,4,If u want it for daily purpose...it's the best in the Range. And if u want to do some heavy work..I would recommend upgrade the Ram to 8Gb
6857,5,It's very nice I loved the slim body of the laptop the function the keys every thing.its excellent gud product to buy and use it nodoubt
6858,4,Good
6859,1,The laptop is completely waste of money it's getting to late to open and hanging tooo much it is not the good product ..waste of money and waste of time .we never expect this from flipkart
6860,3,Very very slow and too lagging
6861,1,Mcfee antivirus not working that was pre-installed for 1 year subscription free

6866,5,"Bought it for 24k . What a bargain buy .. Looks premium and impressed with its display , touchpad and battery performance. Planning to add 8gb ram in future which will change the laptop into monster .. Thank you Flipkart"
6867,4,"Hi,  It's been 4 months since I started using this laptop. I would like to say that it is a good beginners' device for basic functionality; no heating/hanging issues, tactile & responsive keyboard, good color saturation on the screen, charges fast and has moderate weight.  Overall, a good buy for the price."
6868,3,"Good design and light weight but performance is average because it's a budget laptop under 25k. Only for student or normal working or entertainment use, not suggest for multitasking or heavy use."
6869,4,Very nice product i love it .
6870,5,That's nice but performance will be batter after ram upgradation
6871,5,The display and build quality is damn good.Feels premium. Battery life is medium. 4.5 hours-5 hours on full charge. Processor speed is good enough. Ryzen 3 is better than i3 in terms of speed. Front camera is the only down side here.. its below average Overall it is awesome and probably best in the price range.. Theres a brand called Avita which offers higher specs like Ryzen 5 and 8gb ram in similiar price range but again its risky as its not a renowned brand and after sales service can be h...
6872,4,GOOD FOR STUDENTS AND OFFICE WORK
6873,3,"Build quality is good. Sound is very bad, lenevo should improve this. Display is ok. Battery backup is bad."
6874,5,"Excellent Service FK Team & Ekart Team,Firstly Thanking .Product is Good."

6879,1,It take ages to start .. nothing installed yet takes 20 min for bootup... Better buy some other brand
6880,3,"With 4 gb memory, we are not supposed to work on windows 10... too slow..."
6881,5,Good
6882,5,A nice handy product from Lenovo. Ryzen 3 is performing outstandingly. Sound quality is top class. Overall a fine product.
6883,4,Nice laptop with awesome build quality in this price point. Best buy if you are going to do just browsing and simple tasks on laptop.. Best value for money.
6884,2,Laptop get hanged in normal uses. Keep hanging at start and need reset of pc again and again
6885,5,Good
6886,1,Keyboard is not working
6887,5,Worth buy
6888,5,"Using this for 2.5 months now. Primarily to attend Online meetings, Online Classes, Email and working on documents. No complaints at all now. Affordable, looks good, works well. Hope the nice experience continues."
6889,1,System is very slow. It will take atleast 15 minutes to open. After that if you try to open a word document again it will take 30 mnts. Please don't go for this.
6890,3,good
6891,3,good laptop at this price but speaker quality is not good and little heat issue
6892,2,Very sluggish
6893,3,Average Performance
6894,5,Nice Product
6895,1,Very pathetic performance.it gets hanged even if you is being played.not for multitasking. HD video is also seems as a normal standard video
6896,2,"Poor performance, battery backup is too low"
6897,4,Good budget laptop. I was sluggish initially... But was good after few configuration setting changes. The viewing angle of the display isn't good. It can be used for basic office work and online learning
6898,4,"This is the best laptop you can get at this price range, works well for all basic usage, softwares like Photoshop, Movavi Video Editor, etc. also works very smooth üòä"
6899,5,Nice productüòä
6900,5,I am using this laptop from 3 months... This is the best laptop in this price range... Best for your office work...No lagging (disable start up of affecting apps) For students it is perfect to learn and attend online classes... No buffering while playing Asphalt 8...  Just Go For It...
6901,4,Product is good but due some network settings fan started running continuously for 3 days then i went to reset network settings then it has been stopped.....

6909,2,"The Laptop was working fine eventually however later the battery life decrease drastically & the processor slowed down, now it feels like I clicked on n icon q century back & it just loaded the page."
6910,1,Don't even think of buying this if u do that u gonna waste Ur money... It take almost 10-15 minutes even to copy and paste a 30-40 mb file and u know what is even more frustrating that u even can't do anything else while it is copying bcoz it will hang if u try to do so.... Very slow laptop ...my old laptop that I got from gov. For free was better than this....won't buy it even if someone is selling it for 5000 only
6911,3,Good
6912,1,Its the worst laptop. Don't think I am a lenovo hater . Its problems 1. Battery backup is only 1 hour after fully charged 2. Don't even think of buying it for gaming . FPS is low and the laptop hangs . Even with 1gb graphic card and 4 gb ram it sucks
6913,5,Must buy. Excellent and is all rounder
6914,5,Most perfect
6915,4,Pros: ryzen3 is good @this price range : Good display : Premium looking design Cons: build quality is not that good : Touch pad is not so responsive : Hdd

6918,5,Nice just loved it.....
6919,3,Product very good but just sometime.lag this device.
6920,2,"I am writing this review after using this product more than a month. Processor is very slow, it's even hangs up if we work on more than 3 windows at the same time. To me I doubt that the company is actually installed RYZEN 3 processor, since it's seems to be working on some really old processor. Battery backup is also not very impressive all together is not the value for money at all."
6921,2,"Hangs alot. Performance is also very slow. It was having 10days replacement, but these 10days almost take for product installation and after thay when we start to qork gradually things comes up which become hell to even qork"
6922,3,Battery backup is not good
6923,1,"It has not even been a year, and the laptop is terribly slow, mouse has stopped working and one key kept auto typing until I disabled it with external software. I called the customer care, five days back, they haven't sent the engineer yet. My experience is not good with this device since beginning. I Do not recommend this laptop."
6924,1,Takes more than 10 minutes some times to open 1 excel file. Very slow processing
6925,2,Slow. Poor battery
6926,1,Worst things ever purchase Mother board note work after 1 month..
6927,3,Over all good product
6928,2,battery is poor only 1.5 to 2 hour backup not a multitasking laptop
6929,5,Best model under good price rate
6930,1,Very worst product Dont buy Fan sound is very high and both customer care are not responding
6931,1,Keyboard is not working after the use of 2 months...Also The Mouse Pad Is Not Working.... Attempted For Warray
6932,3,after using it for 2 months its pretty slow and worst sound quality
6933,1,"Please, fraud, defective Product, small size not order this product"
6934,2,Low audio and performance
6935,3,"This got a lot of complaints.. battery issues, fan issues.. getting switched off automatically while working. horrible buy.."
6936,4,very good product for student
6937,3,"OCT 2020- System crashed, got it fixed since under warranty. it was motherboard issue and they had to replace it. Now seriously doubt about the RYZEN processors. god knows how i am going to manage after warranty period.  September 2020 Slow system, bought for daughter online classes. Using for around 2 months now. Sometimes it freezes while in online classes."
6938,3,The Camera quality is too bad & the sound of the speaker is too low to listen. Didn't expect this type of quality from LENOVO. Do anyone has the way how to over this issue?  Picture quality is good.
6939,3,Very slow. We Need to upgrade Ram for better performance.
6940,4,If u use a wireless mouse and dont care much about battery life ... it is pretty decent notebook for the price. Suits my need absolutely fine. Have upgraded ram and installed SSD and its pretty quick.
6941,5,"This Laptop has been great so far. I got this for the MS Office offer and Windows that were free. I got this Laptop only for office use. Surprisingly, it runs games from 2012 quite well. Games like Assassin's Creed Black Flag and Batman: Arkham City run well on low settings. This is when I have not even upgraded my ram to 8gb dual channel which was recommended by many tech articles. I will get it later. Remains cool and does not heat up that much. Battery is not that good, but you can use th..."

6946,1,Laptop went dead after 1 month due to keyboard shorting issue. Got it repaired under warranty.  2 months later the keyboard stopped again.
6947,1,"System works very slow, processor not support the regular work, it works toooo slow"
6948,4,Just ok
6949,4,Value for money laptop
6950,3,"Customer support very poor... If someone willing to buy, then put the money in some other use or buy it form nearly shop.. but do not take such product from flipkart.. My money totally lost.. And also lenovo support very poor and disappointing.."
6951,1,The brand new laptop is terribly slow.. there is lag for everything and I wish I can return the product.. not worth it
6952,3,"Ordered it and received ontime. Firstly very bad camera, those who use for online meeting, full grains u can see. Battery drains fast 2hrs max u can use. First 10 days return period it was silent but after that fan started making noise too much don't know any solution to it. Overall average to little above average performance for this price range."
6953,4,good laptop but battery drains faster not satisfied with battery backup it has overall performance is good except the battery backup.
6954,5,I loved it ? WFH People's Just go for it.‚ù§
6955,3,Good for online classes only ..if u try to open multiple tabs it just slows down..web cam and speaker quality really bad..
6956,2,My laptop speaker sound is turn so low. Dnt buy it.
6957,4,I feel little bit slow as hear about other person. Otherwise it is good for office work. Battery is also average not much atleast 2-3 hours giving backup. I will suggest all of u if u want to work day to day lifestyle just go for this laptop.. remember it carefully this laptop coming with plastic body..so plz use protection
6958,3,Sound speaker very worst pls design speaker in top of the laptop dont put sound speaker on down audio level very very low
6959,4,Good one
6960,5,Nice product according to budget
6961,3,Fan makes continuous noise which is irritating. Rest is just like any other laptop in this price range.
6962,4,Super
6963,3,I just think it's an average performing laptop. Maybe that's what you get for this price . ONE TIP use it on the LAP or a STAND if keep it on bed and use it for long it will over heat and start crashing until gets cool
6964,4,Fab oneüî•üî• but battery backup not so good except everything is litüî•üî•

6973,1,"Writing review after 2 week's usage, cheap plastic used for the surface, makes it look like cheap stock. Completely freezes when used with multiple chrome windows, only 1 window of chrome is allowed at a time, its has 4GB DDR4 of RAM but dont know why its not hyper-vising. A simple task of click on the start menu takes 3secs to launch."
6974,4,Good in performance...also under budget..
6975,5,Best Laptop in this Price.
6976,4,"You can get any laptop within any price and if you count on best product within a defined range and especially for students , mid professional with less requirements, lenovo S145 is ideal.  Best for students, accountants. Go ahead with this price range best quality laptop"
6977,4,"Everything is good, the battery backup is 3 to 4 hrs. Could have been better."
6978,1,Very poor performance and dead slow
6979,3,Good but not the best
6980,5,Not a good battery attachment its daraining fast. On base of desing and display its a option for this budget. Overall performance can be more better i think for its not a good option for netflicks. I feel some lag when browsing and it is slow Some times
6981,3,Battery life is pathetic ... Hardly lasts for 2 hours.
6982,5,Nice laptop but sound is not better
6983,4,Good Product
6984,5,Nice laptop screen quality is awesome (1080p). Speaker is also good. Looks are awesome... Runs smoothly... No noise of fan etc.. Mouse touchpad is also good...

7095,5,Nice phone. Worth a money. At this price point what else can you ask for? .. Thanks Redmi.. I found some interesting features in the camera. Nice Disply and it's fast indeed. Battery life is pretty good. Overall it's decent smarty..
7096,4,As usual value for money device.. one thing that attracts me the most is Stereo speakers.. Awesome sound quality.. FHD+ Display is so nice and 6000mH battery as well.. Decent product from Redmi. Go for it Camera quality also decent üôÇ
7097,4,Quality wise good. Good performance of the prize. Cam quality was good what ever it as simply awsome.. üòáüòò
7098,5,I like this phone its very interested features and battery backup is very good & nice camera & nice performance üòä
7099,5,I liked this phone as much as I can praise it. and tha phone is very very good colour thanks you very much Flipkart üíùüôÉüòò
7100,4,After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image. During clicking photo looks good but after save it just worsen quality. Avoid for camera use as you get good photos only in very good lighting like in morning & afternoon.
7101,4,I am using this phone for three days. Speed is good üëçüëç display is cool with a waterdrop notch. Good backup battery. For a budget phone i hada great experience.
7102,5,Nice phone iba very happy camer is good I like it Redmi 9 power
7103,3,"Writing my reviews after 4 days of use. Pros. 1. Side mounted finger senser, it works well. 2. Battery backup is good, easily lasts for a day. 3. Fast charging, works well Cons. 1. Biggest one is camera, its pretty ordinary, I will never believe in their Megapixels value, its not at all 48MP. INFACT, its barely 8MP. AI is also not so good. Front Cam is even worst, Its like a 2MP camera from some branded phone. I dont know why are they putting these many Cameras on the back  I needed a budge..."
7104,4,"Very Good Product. Everything is Good. Best part is battery which is long durable. It could be much better if having- Camera: Some features more Zoom features, require high megapixel for front camera. Procesor: Slightly lower  But interm of value for money, it is very Good Product."
7105,5,"What else do one expects in this price range? Hm... Best in its segment literally, talking about cameras, battery, performance, display and everything else (including Xiaomi MiUi) bestest ever! It's my daddy's smartphone, he'd be greatly using it... I do recommend to go for it, it's just awesome. Here are some shots and a ss for authentication, yes go for it! It's just a perfect phone for everyone (here ""everyone"" means literally ""everyone"") thanks Flipkart and Redmi too!!"
7106,4,Overall good but if you are a camera lover than this is not good for you Battery is like 4000 mh And yes heating issue when you use afternoon time and also while charging it's heating I will give 7 out of 10
7107,5,"May Be Best Pocket Friendly Phone Under 10-15K Gaming Experience Is Smooth As Amul Butter. camera Good, Portrait Mode Is Awesome"
7108,5,At this Price range amazing and fabulous Device... I loved it but back of mobile is big Redmi Branding it is too bad. Xiaomi Please keep branding in small font.
7109,3,"Its a normal smartphone only. Don't get lured by this 48 MP camera , its of no use and on words only. Its capable of taking a normal pic only which even 5 MP cam takes. Better opt for any other smartphone with 6 GB RAM in same price."
7110,5,"I have ordered this for my friend and used couple of days. My opinion  FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS A DAY EARLY.  BATTERY : Was good long lasting Video's, online games didn't made much dent battery ..  Display : display looks clear & very good  Camera : Camera is very good in sunlight & 48 mp camera shot was beautiful.. but night mode not so amazing  Value for money : Yes it is 100% value for money..   Ps : i would have opted for redmi note 10"
7111,5,"Well, after a month's use, I think you'll have to go for this mobile! Great battery performance, camera is quite amazing, charges quickly, the touch is nice, overall, has a great structure :)) For this price, it is a good choice!"
7112,5,"Set is superb and the person who delivered it to me is very nice and trying to make customer valuable by his work ,he delivered it to me on time.thank you üòä"
7113,5,It's a good phone at the price point but you will be slightly disappointed with front camera but considering the price point it's a good deal I am really loving the experience of the performance of the phone even the finger print sensor is also has no great delay and display is excellent Over all it's a good phone at the price
7114,5,Awesome mobile redmi 9 power. It's working nicely and battery backup is Very good. Overall it's a very good item. Thanks.
7115,3,Review after 2months. Budget phone. In this price specification is good. Battery backup is moderate in heavy use but in ideal mode is good. Require +3hour for 0 to100%full charged. Back camera is good but as per 48Megapixel is average. Selfi camera is not good. Body is plastic fiber so is good. Design is awesome. Performance wise is ok. Rating:out of 5star Camera : ‚≠ê‚≠ê Battery :‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Performance:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Design:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Procesor:‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
7116,5,"This phone is amazing and I love this phone like this range awesome processors, camera , display and other features. This phone is very good."
7117,5,1. Notifications LED is not available. 2. Double tapping screen lock feature is not available from home screen. (Only screen on/off is available when screen is lock)
7118,5,I am giving this review after 1 week just to ensure the quality properly. First talk about Flipkart it has given me the decent product no damage no issues. now about the mobile I really like the mobile the performance is very good . No damage everything is fine. Worth purchase. But there is slight heating issue while charging. Other wise it's a decent product.
7119,3,This phone performance is Good But It's Not the Best . Battery backup is also Good Because of The SD 662 11nm Processor.  But there is some issues with the Camera.Quality is not good as expected Front Camera Quality is very poor than REDMI 6 even it has 5MP sensor and 3 Year Old.  And Display produce good picture quality But Display is little bit yellowish and not bright compare to Other Phones.  My Conclusions is if you are looking for Camera and Display then this is not for You.
7120,5,It's a really a good value for money the best part about this phone is its battery backup but the charger is too slow to charge the phone as its only 22watts but the phone only support 18watts but the performance wise it's good but if you play heavy games more than an hour then you might see some frame drops But after the update the problem is solved
7121,4,Good phone camera quality is good and the most important things is battery backup is very good. It will give long last 14 hours to 16 hours on full use of phone
7122,5,The phone has pretty good camera and battery life. Not impressed by the performance though. But as a whole is a good deal as per my choice. Only for thise who need good camera and good battery life. Again has 1080p display which adds a bit of beauty to viewing experience. The speakers are great for the price. Happy with the purchase.
7123,4,Fiery red colour is excellent Battery backup is also very good Camera quality is best Phone was slim and light weight Value for money
7124,5,Under 10k I think this is one of the most powerful phone. The camera works decently and takes clear crisp photos. It easily goes for a day with high usage and 2_3 days with minimum use. The display is large and sharp for watching videos. Performance wise it provides smooth actions.
7125,4,"Its quite good, but camera has got quite sharpness, battery is good, display is like ok, well overall gives good performance with good chipset."
7126,5,Good phone good speaker good battery life no hang very good I love it
7127,5,"It is a very good phone with good features at this price point. The camera is good for this price point, processor is also good, and battery is superb. This phone is made for the daily normal usage and not very heavy games and the phone works very smooth with normal and daily use."
7128,3,Performance is very good and battery is quickly charging and this battery is available upto 24 hours only and camera performance is not equal to 48mega pixel. If you want to good camera please don't buy this mobile. This mobile is very weight for me. Display is good.
7129,5,"Power packed performance, absolutely loved it!! Initially I had a confusion in choosing this phone.

Look at this pic I took. I used gcam and you can do the same thing.Buy this phone, use gcam and done. You can get the best pics. People complaining about it's camera are those people who have zero idea how a gadget is used. Just go for it."

7408,3,I was using redmi note 5 before i buy redmi 9 power. The quality of camera is not upto mark. I felt even some lower priced and previous versions of redmi gives better camera output. The light from flashlight is lesser than note 5. Power of wifi receiver is very less and i find difficulty in receiving signal when i am not so close to the wifi modem. Even my 2016 model phone picks wifi signals better than redmi power.

7430,1,No automatically call record in this mobile
7431,3,At this price range there are many other(mobile) option are available. Camera 48 mega pixel is just to highlight the customer. It gives the quality as 8 mega pixel. Brightness level is also very low in daylight even after it is full. Battery is Ok but to full charge it takes almost 2 hours 45 minutes.
7432,5,The 9 power is amazing budget mobile without compromising necessary features. Battery capacity is the most important one ( stands for 2 days for normal usage ) . UI is also good if you disable the bloatware during initial setup process. Can handle all the daily tasks for a typical user and there is no lag during usage

7458,2,"I bought it one week ago and it has already started lagging. Sometimes it gets too much heated. Battery is good. There is a privacy issue. If you want to record someone's call, the phone let him know that you are recording. So it is very much problematic. There are lot of things that can't be done in this phone.  My only advice for them who wants to buy this phone is ""don't buy it. It's not worth it."""

My old phone's 13 MP single camera is far better than this. Camera may be good for outdoor photography. It's not at all good for indoor photography especially taking photos of any documents written ..."

14611,5,Every phone will have same features but I love Motorola because of its gestures ‚ù§Ô∏è. It hasgood battery It has decent camera It has good processing speed and smooth running Only thing is it has plastic body...
14612,3,Loved the Color Good Finish It's bulky as far as size n it's physical feel is concerned. Display is very dull Almost Stock Android makes accesability quite an easy thing Cam is great for this price point Spot Color Pic is a nice add on in camera 128 GB with 6 GB ram would have been an icing on cake Battery drains off ridiculously. Software issue looks like.. else poor optimization.. 90htz refresh is not a gimmick.. it works and helps create a good smooth experience.
14613,5,"Overall very nice phone with all the latest feature such as android 11. Three finger screen shot , recorder and etc .battery back up is very good big display compared to other phones .camera is also good. Would recommend to buy this phone because its a budget phone with all feature."
14614,4,"Phone is really good in terms of value. With Micromax In1 in market, this one is not ""real"" value for money, I think. Because the display is just 720p... Motorola could have opted 1080p over 90 hertz display. The processor is really good at snappy and does no lag. The camera indoor is pathetic. If we use the pro mode of the camera, we can get a better results even in indoors. Having said that, Camera works good in daylight. I purchased this phone for my father, and my main requirement for me ..."
14615,5,Mobile is very good and performance I gifted my sister on her birthday She is very happy thank u moto and also thank u Flipkart
14616,5,"There are options out there that can give you better value for money like Poco, but this is honestly a very good phone as well. If you have price constraints or don't want to shift to other phone brands, this is the Moto phone to get while the prices are still lower. Personally, from a week's usage, I can tell you that it is a great phone from moto. The selling point for gamers would be its 90HZ refresh rate which the G10 doesn't have, & its custom gametime mode that has some functionality. N..."
14617,4,"Well using the device for the last 3 weeks. Here is the review-  1. Rear Camera is average, auto focus is good. Macro and wide angle has no autofocus, comes with fixed focal length. It takes little time to process the photos in the background (like Gcam) which is very annoying. Front camera is the worst. Low light performance is very poor. Video quality is poor, focusing struggles. Video stabilisation is not available, you have to use Gcam for that. Don't buy if you a selfie maniac or a photo..."
14618,5,Super ... Duper camera very very Excellent handset I love Moto g30 . Low money products very happy products. I am proud of you this is a nice products.üòÉüòÉüòÉ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
14619,4,Overall a decent mobile to purchase if you are not a heavy user. Camera does a good job though it gives realistic pictures so don't expect them to be extra punchy and colorful. 90 hz refresh rate makes the use smoother. Battery lasts long enough to not bother you. And moto unique features are like cherry on the top. You can go for it without even thinking twice.
14620,4,Camer performance is ok not that wow and not that bad in this budget range good performance. Battery life is also ok if use in battery saver mode battery will.work better All over good phone in range need to work but on camera and battery
14621,3,Pros: 1. Smooth Performance And Long-Lasting Battery. 2. Stock Android Software Experience. 3. High-refresh rate display. 4. Good price for value  Cons: 1. Camera Performance Seems Pretty Average. 2. Full Plastic Body which really feels cheap in hand. 3. No 4K video recording. 4. Max display brightness is pretty weak.
14622,2,Its too big & very heavy too. Have the 1st Generation Moto phone which is still working much better than this phone. that was the perfect size which fits into the pocket very nicely. Battery life is also very bad. As everyone can see the reviews the camera is also bad. the 3 finger touch screenshot capture also doesn't work many a times. sound quality also not very good. Expected a much much better product after reading the specifications. But utterly disappointed with the product. Advice is ...
14623,5,Best Product According to price in every aspect. I have trust on Moto because I was using Moto G5S Plus till now(used for 3+ years). Love the software experience Moto provides. Would love to see more options from Moto in 15-20k and 20-25k.
14624,5,One of my favourite brand... N love to see it's coming up with better features every time ... Specially needed this kind of features in budget oriented phones... Loved it..
14625,5,Device looks very promising and the performance is kind of okay. I was hoping with update they might push carrier aggregation (4G+) which really in this device. I like the 90Hz refresh rate and 20w turbocharger.

14629,4,A very good budget oriented phone. Camera is adequate for an average user . A battery which lasts almost 2 days( average use) Big in size which is good for gamers and multimedia users . Clean stock Android experience and guaranteed security updates.
14630,5,This thing has all the acquired characteristics of Moto G family except weight. Based on my experiences with Moto G3 and X Play devices this could be a bit more simpler in matters of usability. It is appreciated even though this bulky and heavier design is an R&D deviation with higher focus on Camera and Graphics. Camera is good in capturing details. NFC as well as sensors used are at par with the pricing. Live caption too works fine. Feels nothing bad for usual graphic apps but battery drain...
14631,5,"To be honest, didn't have much expectation with the mid-ranger but I was amazed at how well it is suited for day-to-day work.  I just wanted a clean UI, quick and responsive phone. (I upgraded from SD435) The moto glass is lightyears better than a notification light.  Moto's little tweaks are way too awesome."

14633,5,"A Great phone to gift your parents or guardians as they don't do much with the phone Camera, good features and compact phone, the Camera could have been better !!! Great battery backup upto 2days on moderate to heavy useage. Smooth Android Experience,"
14634,5,"Moto G30 is overall a budgeted smart phone. Its camera is lagging for 1-2 seconds when u click pic. Also it doesn't have a auto adjustment brightness feature. I had read in other people's comments that display is not upto the mark, but i felt display is nice and smooth. Finishing is awesome and mobile didn't feel heavy also. One can go for it rather than going in MI or realme having short life span."
14635,1,"Am using this mobile from last month. Didn't exchanged my mobile that's my biggest fault.  1. Mobile battery is very fast draining. If I put 100% not used also it's coming to 70%. 2. Cam quality not good. 3. If I talk video call, it heating like hot rod. 4. Taking 3+ hours to full charge. Even it is turbo fast charging. 5.

14636,4,"Camera is not as expected eventhough it's not an issue, battery life is good, complete day I used whatsapp and 4g browsing it's taken only 35 percent so battery optimization is very good. And call quality is decent level. User interface is slightly difference from others, even it's hd+ display, it's better including outdoor and nice refresh rate as I am using only auto mode. Also network speed is fine .I feel if need only call and browse as professionally, this is value for money. Did not try..."
14637,3,"Pros: Best part is the stock android. Performance is good. Camera qualoty os also satisfactory with the price given, doesn't look truly 64MP camera though but with the price of the phone , no complaints.  Cons: Phone batyery is not so good. Charging is slow and power back is not good as well. Pocks up heat sometimes. Its bulky, did not have this expectation from moto. Screen clarity also not so great.  Expected better product from moto."
14638,4,Using Moto for 6+ yrs. Ideal for normal users at this budget with clean UI. Same model with 6 GB RAM variant could have made this much better option to choose compare to other brands.
14639,2,Unbiased and genuine opinion. Bought it for my father but disappointed. Lenevo has degraded moto's standard a lot. Camera: Photos have a soft touch with blurred edges. The details doesn't match the standard of a lower budget phone like poco c3 too. Macro camera is useless. Could have used dual camera setup with better hardware atleast.  Display: If you use a full hd display phone as a daily driver you can easily spot the blurred adaptive icons of the app drawer. There is no necessity of a 90h...
14640,5,"Best look, perfect camera with n number of options, perfect battery backup, sound is just too awesome seems like I'm playing on speakers, screen size is big, came with a back cover in the pack. Perfect option under this price range."
14641,4,"Build quality 5  Display 5  Colors 3  Storage capacity 5  Performance 4 (Because phone becomes slightly slow while performing multiple functions)  Camera 4 (Because night clicks are not at all up to the mark, daylight shots are clean but you get best quality only in 64 pixel shots, normal clicks would have been better)  Battery 5 absolutely amazing.  Worth the price?10 stars....!! Definitely yes... Amazing phone you can get in this price compare to other brands.  If you are looking for be..."
14642,4,"It has 64 MP quad camera that's good it depends upon how you click picture,90 HZ frequency which is nice at this price point, 5000 mAh battery that's also nice, display size is also good, screen could have been more clear when you will see it from side picture will look black, if it would have been super amoled it would have been great experience, ram is 4 GB that is good but processors could have been little bit better, it has light sensor which will adjust your phone light according, face s..."
14643,4,Don't expect much. Camera is good in outdoor but struggle in low light. Battery is good enough for one full day. Performance is above average. It is a value for money product. Far better than '12' in similar price range.
14644,5,"Moto g30 is a superb phone and value for money. The clean android experience with good signal strength, thanks to 2x2 mimo technology, and call clarity. The display and features are really good. In fact I got fed up with my samsung A70S which I bought 1 year ago. So was doubting about the display because I am used to super amoled screen. But my overall experience with motog30 is completely satisfactory. Thanks to flipkart for delivering the phone in 24hrs."
14645,5,"One of the best budget smartphones available in the market. With the tough build quality and sleek design, this phone definitely stands out its competition. Camera is quite impressive for the price range, battery lasts for more than a day while data on, speakers are decent, performance wise- 4GB Ram and Snapdragon 662 work really well, however the display quality could have been better."
14646,3,"ROM AND RAM LESS Camera improved performance in both day and night Pictures looks more realistic Battery stays for 2and half days in battery saving mode for moderate use - calling, whatsapp, yutube songs, online search. Charger not as fast as Samsung charger."
14647,5,Nice mobile Camera is up to average Battery is awesome Build quality is A1 a bit heavy but not so much Performance is good Display also good with 90 hz refresh rate Stock android experience is iout of this world All over a value for money phone in 11k I am happy to buy this phone
14648,3,"I bought moto g30 and there are mainly 3 reasons not to buy it. A) 720p screen, like no one wants that.. But good enough for spare phone. B) There is no way to change SOS calling, on pressing the power button 3 times by mistake the phone will call the emergency helpline, mine does it once a day. Thanks moto. C) They have a secondary physical button which summons the Google assist, there is no way to remap it, it's totally useless. It's fine as a temporary phone or a backup phone, it can't be..."
14649,4,Value for money. Gesture feature is fun. Hey Google works like a charm. Power button position accidentally turns of phone. Display & sound are good for what you paid. Camera is ok. Charging is fast. Go for it if want all rounder under 10k
14650,5,"Nice build, Doesn't bite your pocket, battery is okay, functional side good, touch screen looks wonderful like a feather touch. More than worth for payed"
14651,5,"Very good Phone for gifting to elders, because of super clean software with no spoofs, a very long lasting battery and super fast and responsive display. Excellent for doing everyday tasks. Not so good for performance tasks,or for camera folks"
14652,5,"Camera is average...If you are not the one who is camera centric then I think it would be desirable to buy moto g30. Display is dull compared to other smartphones in this range. Battery- It is giant and nobody can beat moto with respect to battery performance. Gesture add on is a unique feature of moto which is praiseworthy. No heating issues, long battery pack up and fastness of this phone is what attracted me most. Overall a good buy."
14653,4,"I was looking for a mobile which has Stock Android 11 and not much choices ware available. I went for G30 for stock Android , big battery and Motorola brand. After 1 week of usage, Battery - 5/5 awesome, Performance - 4/5 , Value for Money - 4/5 as better processor are available at lower prices but it has Stock android. So far very happy with the mobile."
14654,5,"I love moto phones by its gestures and it's more than average tough body than other smartphones. This time I purchased moto again because of its good quality plus fast charging and no bloatware (Bloatware is commercial software that is preinstalled on a device by the manufacturer, whether it's useful or not, and tends to waste memory and resources. While some of these apps may be useful, the majority of them simply sit there taking up storage space and in some cases, affecting the performance..."
14655,4,"G Non nonsense, decent product for the price, good built quality, value for money & obviously the stock Android experience is always the best with the Nokia or Motorola devices...would have been even better if Motorola had launched the 6-128gb version along with this"
14656,5,"It is nice but expected a better performance, because motrola is a very good brand . But this is good phone so guys go for it."
14657,4,"I am impressed with it's Stock android UI and features. Camra and is better than average. It can shoot like 32 MP flagship camera. Display quality is average. Camera app is little bit lagging I hope it will be improved by app updates. But MOTO can improve your some features.ie 1. Add convert in their CALCULATOR. 2. Record voice of video in SCREEN RECORDING. 3. Give app lock in SECURITY SETTING. 4. Give feature to adding other video, audio and photo in the middle of video in VIDEO EDITOR"

14665,5,"Excellent device at this price. I bought this as my secondary phone mostly to netflix and other stuffs. Battery backup on screen time is 12+ hours on a full charge which is amazing. Camera is good, not the best but works Excellent with Google camera so you can download from xforum.

Performance is good, it handles multiple apps simul..."
14666,5,"Motorola phones are underrated perhaps because they do not do publicity like few trending brands in the market. The UI is clean free of bloatware so less background process running increasing battery life and speed. RAM management is excellen, moto shortcuts are excellent and very very hand. Build quality is good. I have few other moto phones running without any issue after even 4 years of rough use. The camera is average and could be improved.

14667,5,"I am writing this review after a month of using the mobile. I was previously using Moto e4 and hence o upgraded to g30 of same brand. The features have been very good. The camera clarity and the video clarity has been excellent. Cost fitted my budget well. Has additional features like screen recording, call recording among others. I am very happy with the mobile and as well the delivery service by Flipkart!!"
14668,5,Its a decent phone for everyday use and performs well for normal usage and i feel the battery backup is pretty impressive as i gifted this to my dad who is pretty happy with it and due to close stock android no ads or malware are bugging my dad so it is pretty neat and user friendly i can say.
14669,3,"Recommended only for those who are love stock android experience. G30's camera and screen resolution üëéüëéüëé My 1st aim to buy these phone for stock android experience. If you want best camera and best screen resolution G30 is not for you. My old great phone is lenovo k6 power use about 4 year and that's brilliant camera,full hd,lot of features and Extra ordinary battry life but sadly He is no moreüò£üò£ i miss that phone.

14672,5,"I am proud to mention that I own Moto G30 and chose the same over nord. What I like - It's compact.  Display is not the best like you get in flagship phones but yeah considering the price point it is definitely at par with the devices in this range.  Processor is more than enough if you're not a pro gamer and every other task feels so smooth. Infact the entire device feels fast in daily normal usage.  Google has taken care of every small detail like haptics, microphone, speakers minimalistic ..."
14673,1,"Simply worthless device ( My device at least) . Every time it gets a bit more load , it hangs and stops working. Above that I think it has some issues over wifi connectivity . All the other devices at my home work flawlessly with my router , apart from this one. In this device I get "" No Internet "" quite often while using wifi , while other devices are working fine . And there is no inbuilt app locker or something like that . My previous Redmi 5a with only 3 gb of ram was better than this."
14674,5,Everything is perfect except battery. I really love all the features. I recommend these phone to all. Battery Capacity is not good from my exceptation.
14675,5,"This new phone looks great , main advantage is bloatware free software and battery backup.Its now running on android 11 out of the box.It really gives 48gb free space for you out of 64 gb after installing OS.In 11,000 price range with all other features is good value.Make sure to use back cover and tempered glass when using this phone,it will work great after this. Disadvantage is hybrid sim slot."

It has a 64MP AI quad camera which captures the worst quality pictures and it is literally slower in performance and hangs quite a lot.

14777,1,"Very Weak, a simple fall from 1feet broke the screen and became unusable. Other cons about this useless phone is - it feels heavy. Charging is very slow(even 33w) and dis-charing is very very fast. Please don't waste your money on this stupid phone. Only good thing about the phone is its camera and stock android. And since moto is the only phone with stock android, had to purchase."

14790,1,Writing my experience after 7 days.I buyed this phone for my mom. And it's lagging just using youtube.I suggest you Realme Narzo insted of this product. Very bad experience. I buyed this just because of snapdragon processor. But it has also hanging issues with limited apps

14807,5,Good product compared to it's price. I think this is the first device to have advanced security(Think shield) for budget device. SAMSUNG provides knox security only for premium device
14808,5,Very good mobile! When I bought this phone gpay QR code does not work now the problem is solved by Motorola updated thank you Motorola network speed is little slow may be because of processor hope this will also solve soon I love the phone 'cause the name is MOTOROLA!

14826,1,Battery not working due to unavoidable reason I am not able to replacement within 7 day (stringent policy of 7 day even in Pendamic)
14827,2,I am not satisfied this product
14828,1,I've been using Moto phones since first Moto-G generation and I must say that all the phones have done justice to their price. But this phone is really slow and has lag which is not a trait of moto phones .The worst thing about this phone is its battery life.
14829,2,Sound quality is not good..nd camera is not performing well..
14830,1,"Camera quality and screen touch is so bad, battery backup is poor I am so disappointed from this"
14831,5,Don't trust the old negative reviews. I am using this phone for past 2 weeks it's really awesome
14832,1,Very worst product and flipkart services or camera quality and build quality is very bad
14833,5,Nice product good quality thanks to Flipkart
14834,5,It's really nice..the colour is classy. Value for money and even really work smoothly and the camera is good but cant even expect much in such rate...if you are still confuse I suggest you might go with it as the phone all over is awesome.

14840,3,"Battery drains quickly being a 5000MAH it has to have atleast 24 hours of battery life but it gets drained everyday and you have to charge it for every 12 hours, Camera is good, Display is average, Heating issue when browsing (Facebook, WhatsApp or other social networking apps) & YouTube etc. It comes with a 20 Watts fast charger for a name sake only. You cannot apply a theme to it but you customize apps appearance, apply colors & various text formats or styles. This is one of the average pho..."
14841,1,"Wifi connectivity is bad, continuously disconnects even after resetting the phone and network settings same problem, very unstable. Had to return and get a replacement but the replacement phone has the same problem. Guess this is a problem with this model. Don't even think of buying this phone. Motorola has lost its value. I regret getting this phone. Also don't ever trust YouTube reviews. I trusted them and now am suffering. Total waste of money."
14842,3,"Camera quality is very poor I'm using Samsung M30s @48mp which is far better than this, u can opt this mobile if camera isn't an option for you, performance wise this phone rocks.."
14843,3,Average performance
14844,1,Camera quality is poor...don't buy from flipkart..they don't refund the money

14854,1,Worst phone. Don't by this product. Camera is not good even it is 64MP. In browsing there is no back button at all. We need to install the Assitive touch.why we need to install? Poor quality in calls. Suddenly it will disconnect the call.
14855,1,seroius issue with upi system just go for any other alternative
14856,3,Over-all nice performance with stock android. SATISFIED ü§ó
14857,5,I used only Motorola mobile for last 17 years. I purchased 7-8 Moto mobiles till now. best product. camera is best. battery back up is also good. best product in this price .

14864,2,It's too heavy and big size like Power Bank think 2 times before buy
14865,1,Only camera and battery is good and all performance is not good
14866,1,Display is not 90Hz. Switch on the developer mode and there you'll find out. That's a sure lie. Camera is of low quality. Can't capture with detailing. Weight of the device is too much.
14867,1,Display worst better Don't buy this
14868,1,"Waste of money to take Motorola G30. front camera is not good , touch screen is not good.  Instead of Moto g30 take Moto g 5 plus."
14869,3,"Overall at this price, everything thing is balanced. It is better if it comes with Full HD Bulky, thick useless bezel at bottom. Slow charging, should come at at least 30W or more power charger. Given 5 star because at this price we can't compare with 20k segment. Expect timely security updates and Android update fron android.  One line for Flipkart: product reached 4 days before to nearest hub, but they deliver on last day doesn't make sense"

14876,4,It is a good budget phone which can be used for daily purposes such as calling & Social Media. Battery is good which will give you a whole day power with single charge...  Preferred for students for online class purposes only...  This phone does support gaming but there are heating issues and some lags while playing Huge games such as COD....
14877,5,"Received the phone in exchange of old phone. Moto is a super phone especially for senior citizens. Durable for years.. Good buy under 12k. Smooth premium look.. Battery stands for a day in a high usage.. Average camera despite of having 64mp, but can ignore it at this price.  Checked liked and recommended."
14878,3,"Let me list out all the pros and cons of this Moto G30. Pros: -Stock Android -Overall Build and Quality - -Price (11k) -USB C Charging -Display 90 hz, you can watch videos more smoothly and more frames per second.  Cons: -Camera is avg at best, Disappointed with moto. 64 MP is just on paper, its quality is not that good, but then again its a 11k phone. -Extra Button for Google assistant is waste and useless. -Fast Charging problem is its Fast Draining also, thats why I am using third..."

15122,1,Worst phone I ever used!!! Bought this phone only because I had complete trust in Motorola. I bought this on April first weeks. Talking about it's features; * Battery - Battery is taking more than 2 hours 40 mins to completely charged and it will drain in 1 day's usage. * Camera - I think camera they are provided is just a gimmick to specify it. A 16 MP other cameras will work better than this 64 MP quad cam. * Dispay - Nothing to say. Ultra poor!üò∂  ** I can't even use my sim properly. First...

Most of the devices in the market in similar segment comes with plenty of ad filled OS and user data harvesting apps. Considering the features it provides it's enough for day to day life. This is the only device I found ad less, comparatively less data harvesting ( I recommend to use Blockada to block tracking ).  Motorola till now live up to my expectations.

Nice 720P display 2. 5000 mah battery with 20w turbo adapter 3. 4/64 GB - 48 GB available for use 4. Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 - Adreno 610 5. Stock android with Android 11 out of the box Cons : 1. First ever in stock android I've seen companies software not ..."

15420,5,Average
15421,1,Review after 3 months..giving only 1 star..worst mobile I ever bought.Camera is not good and very important thing is very Poor network connectivity .Please don't buy anyone using internet..it's dead in low coverage areas and no connectivity when Moto g5 plus has.No carrier aggregation added..even low budget phones have.
15422,1,The worst mobile
15423,5,Awesome
15424,5,Good product. Having a stock android is the best thing. Camera is ok. Battery life is good too(Once charged it works for 2 days).

15436,5,"The device is slightly bulky and with a cover it will be even more. Camera is good if you have proper light, macro is just for aesthetics makes the camera bump looks cool. Fingerprint scanner is fast and face unlock is again dependant on light on your face and is slow. Phone has bit of a chin but it's not a con by any mean. As always vanilla android software experience is good. For the price it's a good deal. If you wish to take little risk same price can fetch you infinix or low-end Samsung'..."

15629,1,It's creating a lot of problem...when I requested from flipkart for exchange they try to manipulate my decision with some basic steps for me to follow..at that time the phn started working well...but after sometime it's now creating the same problem the mic of phn is not working properly ..my voice is not audible to the other person whom am talking on the phone.
15630,3,"Build quality, specs according to the price seems to be okay. I highly doubt the camera being a 64MP one. Its not up to the mark(feels like below 13mp). Battery is decent but not for gamers. Over all this phone will be a great choice within this price range. I'll suggest to buy from any store rather than ordering it from online sites."

15642,4,Overall it's a good device. Specifications are good as per its price range. My overall experience/opinion after one month of use of this mobile phone...  Pros. 1) It's not an amoled displayed mobile but touch is very smooth because of its 90hz refresh rate. 2) Build quality is good. 3) Battery performance good. For normal user battery can go upto 1.5-2days. 4) Smooth & fast performance. No heating issues. 5) Good for normal daily users. I do not play games on mobile so don't have any knowledg...

15829,5,"SD 662 is decent processor for day to day work, work very well. No issues while operating mobile phone. Build quality is also very nice. Two major issues, 1. Camera: No use of 64MP, it only take 16MP pics and that too processing is too slow, if you take any picture, it take almost 10 to 15 seconds to process that pic, than only we can see pic if that is correct or have to click again.

15911,1,First of all very Low battery backup and very slow charging. Very hyped and advertised product of another CHINI company. It has slow charging and Less Battery backup than my 4 Year OLD Redmi Note 4 mobile. where as I am using it Brand New Model of Moto30 g from 25.05.21 And after 1 week of modest use it gives backup of Half day and after no use it gives backup of less than 20hours.So what the use ofso caller 20watt fast charging nad 5kmAh LiOn battery.

I like Motorola in providing near stock android experience. Thanks for keeping that while most of the brands comes with lots of junk apps. I personally like moto action, and display features. Really useful. Charger is just okay. Except camera and charger It's a good choice. I will write detailed review later"
15918,3,"Just okay okay type. Sound system is not good, not loud enough!"
15919,2,Camera quality not good as expected with moto brand. Not recommended to bay this
15920,4,"Being a Motorola user for a long time, this product is good at this price segment. Battery I didn't find long staying. Camera is better than moto one series model. Overall nice mobile not a ok product."

No dedicated slot for memory card. 720 x 1600 pixels resolution for 11K? Not worth the money spent on this. Too bad. Thought about returning it but can't wait for a refund etc and instead gave it away to my sibling who uses it only for calls and Youtube."

15994,1,Battery life is unsatisfied. Slow charging is also a big problem for this. after 1.5 hour charging your will get charge from 6% to 53% . This 53% charging get drain within 1.5 hour. some time touch problem is faced by me. back cover colour is worst than expected. Previously i used moto G6. Moto G6 is perfect model. From the good experience pf moto G6 i purchase moto G30. But this model is really unsatisfied. I have purchased this model due to 5000mah battery but it really unsatisfied me.

16183,5,The best
16184,5,This phone is okay in its own divinity. But Buying this phone is a complete waste of money. It's not upto the mark of value for money because it's costly for its price and for the phone in the class of its performance shouldn't be as costly as it is. Motorola is a well known company and they should work on the camera of this phone. My Moto e7 plus having 48MP quad camera snaps better picture than this G30 which has 64MP camera. It's so sad that I had to venture in to this phone. Please guys l...

16216,4,good
16217,3,"Given the previous Motorala Models, this is better in comparison. But still not upto the market standards"
16218,4,"This mobile is not for the ones who want to use it for gaming, other than that 90HZ refresh rate really makes it smoother to use and performance is really great and battery sometimes lasts for 3 days. Go for it if you doesn't want to use it for gaming. It would've been 10/10 of they had provided us with 1080p display."

16293,4,Good phone
16294,5,I am getting battery backup of two days with a moderate use with minimal game play  Continuous use device I am getting battery backup of 12 to 13 hours with heavy game play like Asphalt and pubg
16295,4,Mobile performing good. Good battery backup. As you know stock android give you a best experience of android. But phone camera is disappointed. Camera performance is below average in comparison of other same range mobile.
16296,3,Camera is totally disappointing for indoor or low light captures...rest are good

16307,3,"While the phone is good, the battery is woefully inadequate. The new phone charged to 100% doesn't even last for a day, that too without much use. Phone is bit heavy, but manageable. Stock Android is an advantage over other budget phones."
16308,4,"My only concern is the weight, still waiting for mobile like moto x4. Less Mah but quality and look was top notch."

16331,5,Good Quality
16332,3,"Good to use , if you are not really care for Camera, 64 MP camera : Seriously üò≥, just pathetic. Please buy it if you are going to use for normal cases."

16340,3,Battery is delay charge and empty early. Front camera is poor. Style is good. Heatting problem.
16341,5,"Totally worth it, I have used moto g, moto g4 plus and this one. Excellent value for the price. I wouldn't say it is the best quality but can definitely use it for 2years.  USB C is not 3.1, it is still 2.0. You cannot really use all functions of usb c such as connecting to a bigger screen through hdmi cable. It is just a minor thing though."
16342,5,Awesome.....
16343,2,Camera quality is very baad. Its not 64 mega pixel.

16363,5,"Nice phone,superb battery backup go for it."
16364,3,"Internet speed is low , do not work as i expected Dont buy if you use for browsing ."
16365,4,Camera pulls the package down always in low range moto phones! Everything else is good in this device. Bit bulky! Overall for basic use it's a good purchase. Bang for buck! Battery display and performance is üëå
16366,5,Best mobile üì≤
16367,5,"Phone is working perfectly fine. Camera could be little improved, hope they give software update to rectify it. Overall it's budget friendly and best valued in this price range."
16368,5,Good product
16369,4,Posting the review after a week of use. Overall a good budget phone for this price. Phone is sleek and looks elegant. For a 64 MP camera the picture quality is not that great but takes good clicks in daylight. Lenovo should improve the focus on its cameras though. Phone works fine in day to day normal usage. Snapdragon 662 chipset works well and you don't see much lag. You can buy it for normal usage in this budget segment blindly. üôÇ
16370,3,Camera is bad
16371,4,Product is good but while in a cal after 15mins it gets heated thats why i rated 4

16381,5,Very good phone in this range
16382,4,Its a Good Phone. Nice design and Weightless mobile. the only disadvantage is the display is not as much as good. otherwise overall its fantastic!
16383,4,Camera's need to improve
16384,5,"No Oleophobic coating on the screen or atleast a screen protector is a bummer for me for this price.  Camera performance in not upto the mark. They say 64mpx but the pic quality is like that of a 13 mpx camera, which needs an update sooner."
16385,5,Excellent
16386,4,nice phone
16387,5,Very nice Moto
16388,5,"I trust Motorola .... because they given the first mobile in the world.....in my concept Motorola is the mother of all mobiles...... this moto g30 also excellent...... camera quality , battery life , display... everything is good......."

16391,5,Good quality.
16392,4,Good looking with great performance

16394,3,Gud
16395,3,"Camera struggles a lot to focus on text of a document. Really bad and unexpected. 1 good thing I noted, it blurs background of a object in clicks, throws some extra focus & depth that enhances the object view. Check in pic. Battery could have been better, screen felt average or ok. Display is again just ok"
16396,5,Must buy no other phone is better than Moto I have started using Moto phones since G4 plus have launched. Trust it blindly and in this range what else you expect..
16397,4,"Its a good phone, after 1 month i can say this"

16408,3,"Battery doesn't last even for a day with moderate use. I don't use this done for gaming or streaming, moderate number of calls and microsoft teams for official purposes still the battery hardly last for a day. Low light performance of camera is poor, but gives good results in proper lighting. Camera and youtube crashed multiple times. If u r on a budget go for this, I opted this fone for the price and clean android experience. No unnecessary bloatware. Display is decent. My old one plus 3 ..."

16423,5,Good
16424,3,not so good in camera and display
16425,5,Best Mobile under 10000
16426,3,"Overall this phone is good for basic usage , but battery got heat up once start playing game or internet surfing for more than one 1 hour. If u are buying for basic stuff like texting or calling..then go for it."
16427,1,worst camera
16428,3,Good customer service thank you Flipkart but camera quality poor
16429,5,The product is good although the packaging seemed a bit distorted

16436,3,Battery draining very fast. Camera too slow
16437,5,Good experience with Moto mobiles. Super mobiles at lowest price
16438,1,Don‚Äôt expect much from the camera and performance ..as Flipkart didn‚Äôt arrange my return had no option but sold the device ... even though 665 processor but it was slow in shifting through apps.
16439,3,Writing this review after using moto g30 for 10 days. The battery is good. It last almost two days after normal uses. Camera is not good specially the front camera. The phone is little heavy. Just good enough for normal uses not recommended for photography.
16440,2,"Don't but this phone camera is very bad , Display also Dull , lagging issue also we have purchase this phone for my dad purpose but on 1st day we will find this much issue compare to redmi note 10 the camera is very bad 64mp but look like China phone camera blur also,Don't waste your money for this budget better go to redmi 9 powder / note 10"
16441,1,"Camera quality is not good , voice issue and maine issue in battery. I think it is worsted company in phone."
16442,2,If others call me will said switch off
16443,2,Camera is not that great. 6gb ram version would have been preferred.
16444,5,Good
16445,4,Wow wow
16446,5,"awesome, bloatware ad free experience"
16447,1,Display is really bad. Brightness level is very low. Unable to see anything in sunlight even after putting maximum brightness. Seller is providing replacement only. Worst customer support from Flipkart. In future I will rethink before buying a product from FLIPKART.
16448,1,Slow charging.... Poor cemara quality....
16449,5,"In time delivery, and friendly behavior of the delivery boy. Highly impressed."
16450,5,Value for money. Lag free performance. stock android experience is good.
16451,1,"Don't buy any kind of product from Flipkart, the product they have given is faulty and 7 days replacement policy also not in used.  Very worst experience with customer care.  Regards, Pravin"

16455,4,"In this price segment ,it is a good phone"
16456,4,"The phone looks good, but flipkart exchange policy is very bad. Despite software in working condition, due to discoloring of pixels the phone got rejected."
16457,1,So poor. I want to exchange this set.üò†
16458,1,"Phone has multiple software bugs ;  abnormal battery statistics n draining, GPS n NFC keep getting ON & OFF automatically, very poor RAM management, no option for receiving incoming calls ( sometimes ), very poor network connectivity ( I've only Jio & Airtel ),  Finally no proper response from Motorola Team, as if they were in a Jiffy to launch this model.  Don't know anything about camera, since I seldom use smartphone camera."
16459,4,Value for money and this price segment is best option..and better than realme .redmi. mi. Vivi..and oppo
16460,3,"Camera average...Motorola should improve,not just launch products for competition...   Motorola is bigger brand ,hence should focus to give quality not quantity."
16461,1,Dont buy this phon camera quality is very very poor   Best of money
16462,5,"Excellent Camera, Nice RAM Management, Elegant Design, Awesome Product !!!"
16463,3,Good
16464,4,Good budgets phone with 2 weaknesses 1 display 2 processor
16465,3,Display is not so good. Rather opt for a fhd display of poco at this price. Performance is no doubt good. But the device has a heating issue when charging. The device and the charger both gets heated up. Value for price of course. But it could have been better.
16466,4,Nice a photo
16467,4,Camera can be fixed by some settings you get a decent pic Battery performance is good and its last for one and half a day. Performance is excellent for day to day use.. Built is quite heavy due to big battery but get use to it after some day. Stock android phone... And with one weak of use its worthy and u can bet on it... Not for those who are selfie addicted üõë
16468,3,overall good..
16469,1,"This is about the product, its description and content. For this product code, there should be two sim slots and one memory slot.

16502,2,"The phone I received is having very fast battery drainage and heating issues while charging. When I requested for replacement, the Flipkart team arranged a technical visit to check whether my phone actually has problems & according to their policy, they replace the phone only if the battery drains 15% while recording a video in HD for 20 mins.

16503,4,Everything is soo good but it heats a lot. While charging it heats up to 43 degrees Celsius. Other than that its amazing. It would be better to buy it after you verify once. Later after some days it will be fine and performed good. It's good at this point
16504,5,Nice one
16505,5,Used moto g30 for a week I would rate: 4/5 for camera 5/5 for battery 5/5 for performance 5/5 for display 20w fast charger is also give in the box And for 11k it's worth buying this product
16506,3,Good mobile but again ordered it considering my brother's birthday but received 2 days later.

17468,4,This Motorola E7 plus is simply superb. It's perfect at this cost (below Rs.9000). Decent phone.. Full value for money. 50% Battery stands upto 8 hours of YouTube usage (I would recharge when it comes 50% battery). So with internet usage it will come upto 16 hours or more. Without internet usage it took 15% of battery for 24 hours. So obviously it will come upto nearly 7 days for full charge. At my point of view only one draw back that is camera quality they told that camera has 48MP but it i...

It is big disadvantage to have only option of one sim and one memory card or two sim card no memory card. Secondly camera quality is bad. Image quality is not like 48 MP. Design is not very good...

18572,4,Hey guys I have used this phone for almost 20days So the review are based on it  Camera -3/5 The camera quality must be improved amd it's quite low quality time and for videos I will give 1/5 because it's too poor quality Anyways I can take satisfactory pics.  Performance of - 4/5  The reason behind this is sometimes the device works slowly. I have a problem with its Wi-Fi and sometimes network because it is slow and sometimes it doesn't open.   Battery is 5/5 Ekdam mast hai bhai log...

The phone supports 18w micro USB fast charging, but the the 10w charger is good and I would suggest use the in box charger. The camera quality is decent and no issues in daylight, people complaining about picture quality must realize this is a budget phone what more do you expect Overall the phone is definitely a must but especially for the stock Andro..."

Overall :- the product is really good but I'm not going to say excellent and I'll update if I like or dislike ...

19258,1,Worst mobile...... Not recommended any body
19259,4,"Don't believe on YouTube reviews, I'm using this mobile and it's a good phone. If you are looking for a mobile phone for your parents then this can be an excellent choice. It's fast, bloatware free and you can do little bit of gaming with low to medium settings. Battery backup is excellent more than 2 days but charging could have been better. I got a good deal with exchanging a old mobile phone. So I'm happy with this purchase. Not recommended for hardcore gamers or camera lovers, a big NO."
19260,5,"Great phone for price range great camera and battery display is also good nice performance also the charging is also fast, overall 5/5 I will update reviews regularly this is after 2 days of use. Back cam has modes like slowmotion and more. Which is good thanks flipkart for 3 day delivery."

You can compare the video and photo quality to any phone you are using and you will b highly disappointed.Don't waste your hard earn d money. You can not return the mobile once you switch on the mobile. You will feel cheated and you won't be able to return this product.

19751,5,With Moto E7 plus you will get the Value for money and a strong belief of Motorola as there has been no complaints on Moto devices since I had one for my mother before this so I opt for Moto again without thinking of anything for her this time. The best part of this device is its premium feel in this range with the solid packaging of the device qhen you use it continuously. It has a stock Google Android experience with updates directly from Google for the next two years similar to all stock A...

If you compare same configuration mobiles from other brands this is the best one as this mobile offers 48MP Camera, 5000mah, 4GB RAM, Clean UI and mainly Snapdragon 460.

20213,2,I have taken this phone in big billion days sale of 16 to 21 October 2020 . First of all thank you flipcart for delivery of the product before expectation time. Phone is good except Camera of the phone. Front camera is just like VGA camera . I am one of the very old customer of Motorola but not expected like this from this brand.
20214,2,Front camera is worst in the price range.
20215,1,"This phone has number of issues. I bought it a 3 weeks before, Alarm system is not working at all.It has sound issue while during the call. Many other frequent problems occurs. I stopped buying products from filpcart."

20225,5,Good product delivered by Flipkart
20226,4,Phone is good but nowadays phone screens are too big. We can call phones tablet lite version. Not handy Night vision camera is too good. But day light images are ok ok. Rest all is good but little bit heavy. I request motorola to make handy phone because moto phones are too heavy and strong plus big screens make the phone little bit unhandy....
20227,4,Ok
20228,4,"Overall performance good. But some features missing like vibrate when answered,apps lock. Front camera performance average.back camera performance good. Battery backup & display awasome."

20243,4,Best pure Android mobile under 10k (I bought it for 8100) without any add or unnecessary apps. Super camera. Overall good. Only one thing is low power charger. Better to buy higher power charger to charge quickly.

20250,5,Display: One gets a very clear display on this device. Good for streaming and gaming.  Battery: Little disappointed by the battery. Says it 5000mAh but doesn't last that long. Though it's good.  Camera: set the camera manually and the results are amazing. Slow motion videos are pretty good. Also Selfie camera is impressive.  Other features: Motorola has given there one of the best phone in this price range. I have been using it now for more than 20 days and I am impressed. It have notificatio...
20251,5,Best phone in this price
20252,5,Best budget phone in this price
20253,4,"Best budget phone, but face unlock is not good. Every morning it shows to unlock the phone through pin, pattern, password"
20254,3,Moto's credibility for its build quality is degraded with this device as it's screen cracked at top right corner and with few week of usage there is lots of scratches visible without protection screen. Battery life is also quite poor even with 5000mah battery. Screen display is usable and device performance and camera is good considering the price segment.

Quality of camera is not this much satisfied. 13MP of e4 plus is much more good from this one. Same for battery backup. In both mobile battery is 5000 MAH. But backup in very much good in e4 plus. My suggestion is, if you are planning for buy this one than I recommend you should go with moto e4 plus not with e7 plus."

No case in Box, No Secondary Microphone But it Takes better photos than the MOTO G9!!! It blows my mind. Compared Well lit and Low lit Photos. In Moto E7 plus, I just have to take a single shot and can expect the photos to look good whereas there is focusing issues in the G9."

20385,1,Received today...Ok as of now will review after a week usage Everyday I am hating this mobile after 2 weeks Iam done..such waste from motorola... Go for realme...my old realme 3i gives better picture quality than this mobile.. I bought realme 3i again after using this Camera was utter flop... Worst 48 MP ever.. output is 12 MP.. even if ...it is worst.. it says 4gb ram but hardly performs like 3 or 2 gb only dont buy for camera/ram.. buy for clean android that at 6k range ....
20386,4,Very good product
20387,5,"Awesome mobile and good looking this mobile value of many, good delivery thanks to Flipkart"
20388,3,Graphics is not upto the mark. Camera is ok and little above average even 48MP also.Having trouble in data connectivity.even though it is having higher band configuration.touch sensitivity is not satisfied. Felt little slow .  Battery and sound in good for this price. Have to accept the fact it is a low budget mobile. Even though the configuration and performance not met as they mentioned.7k is ok price for this one
20389,5,Overall superb mobile at this price
20390,4,Camera will disappoint you.. images are soft and not sharp for both rear and selfie cam.. night vision is also okayish.. 48 MP is only for attracting the customers to buy it
20391,3,Product is good but delivery was late
20392,1,Bad camera of back side..it has mirrarcast problem in all phones..I think some of money will west to invest.. My suggestion is don't to buy did product

20409,5,"Excellent, price worthy"
20410,5,Best phone ever with no junk under 10k with new Snapdragon 460 processor and solid body.
20411,5,Nice model for mid range users...
20412,5,Better
20413,1,Camera is cheap
20414,4,Front camera quality was not that much good quality.. Over all ok for the money.
20415,4,Everything is good under this price range except for the USB type B port. It does NOT have USB type C. And doesn't have turbocharger included. Has a basic charger.
20416,4,"Overall good phone for it's price range, Motorola is trustworthy brand , and more importantly this phone is made in India, that is biggest plus point. It may show little glitches sometimes. I also needed to change that gesture navigation feature, it makes phone painful to use, You can change to three button navigation from settings. To add back button go to settings>system> gestures>system navigation>3 button navigation. It will solve your problem."
20417,5,Nice phone

20434,1,"Don't buy this phone, in this phone brightness is very low quality, front camera is very poor. Battery backup is also of poor quality."
20435,5,Ok Ok
20436,5,Nice phone...
20437,5,Well I have been using this phone for quite a time now and i can tell that it is the best non-chinese smartphone in its range .The battery backup is working incredibly and till now the 10W charging is also not much of a trouble haven't tried 0-100 but it did charge the phone from 47 to 89 in 22 minutes which is finely appropriate.The performance is incredible but it does take some mere seconds for loading the apps after you restart the phone but again watching the price range its fine.Talking...
20438,1,I hate network speed this phone give some updates
20439,5,Good products üëç
20440,5,"Super, Value for money.."
20441,5,Most mind choice mobile
20442,5,Stock android no bloatwares and a decent camera. All in all a good buy.
20443,5,Great product for this price tag!
20444,4,Good in price
20445,5,Budget king
20446,4,"Camera Quality is not so good, I'm using Moto One Power currently with 16MP rear camera but Moto One Power camera is too good in comparison to 48MP of MOTO E7 PLUS."
20447,5,"So I brought this one in Big Billion Day sale and: PROS: 1. Smooth texture experience. 2. Playing media quality is great. 3. Calling quality is good too. CONS: 1. Battery backup quality has started deteriorating in just a few days. 2. Forget heavy gaming, cannot even handle moving big files or any other heavy RAM use activity. 3. Camera quality is too poor for a 48 MP camera. 4. Allows only 2 sims (without SD card) or a sim and a sd card. Doesn't have 3 slots for idk what reason."
20448,5,Awesome product
20449,2,do not buy completely waste this product
20450,5,Just awesome
20451,4,It is amazing mobile
20452,5,Nice but company should provide earphones also
20453,4,Alike professional
20454,5,Look wise very smart phone i give 5 star
20455,4,"Everything is good at affordable price. Two drawbacks as per my observation. 1. We can't able to insert 2 sims and memory card at a time, either we can use 1 sim and 1 memory card or 2 sims only. 2. In setting there is short cut option for mobile data changeover and all. Next SMS can be sent only with a single sim, if we need choose sending sms it need to he modified in setting only. 3. Screen looking dull but there is no strain for eyes, comfort feel is there."
20456,5,It's a perfect product for elderly use. It can't be used for heavy usage but it's perfect for daily use considering the usage and price it's probably a good option. If you need it for basic use and not for gaming and all go for it but it can't handle heavy usage.

20565,3,Phone looking super but processing slow
20566,2,Very bad camera quality... Even Not have 13mp camera. It's showing 48mp..but .we didn't get as much quality. We get only 13or 8mp quality.

20572,1,"Battery is not good. If using the net, the battery backup is 12 to 15 hrs. Battery charging takes 7 to 8 hours, very slow charging speed. My Moto G4 Play was better than this, it used to charge fast."
20573,4,Nice product
20574,5,Battery and performance is good . it's a most value for money rather than other brands .I like the stock android
20575,3,"No fast charging option. No back case provided in the package, poor package. Phone seems to be good at this price. If possible will try to write a review after few days of usage.."

20579,3,"Camera is crap. Display is also bad. Good things are like bloatware free almost stock Android experience, big battery with 64 GB storage. It's not a value for money product compared to other offerings at this price point. Mi & Realme can offer more value. You can go for this phone only if you're a stock Android fan & you don't wanna use custom UI."

20595,4,Display is good but camera and phone body quality could have been better. It‚Äôs too big. Instead of focusing on length they could‚Äôve improved body quality otherwise it‚Äôs worth the money.

20641,3,"Pros : 1.) Good phone for this price and that too with Android stock experience. 2.) Decent Camera  Cons: 1.) Bit surprised to see, the package didn't contain a headset, eventhough the device supports 3.5 jack 2.) Would have been nice, if there was a dedicated memory slot, rather than messing up with the 2nd sim slot.  My intention was to upgrade my Nokia feature phone which I bought in year 2012 which is still in working condition, with its original battery and so on. Ex..."

20668,3,Thanks Flipkart for super fast delivery. Writing this review after using the phone around two weeks.  Pros:- 1. STOCK ANDROID!!! 2. Robust design. 3. Good battery backup. 4. Great speakers. 5. Water resistant upto some extent as rubber sealing can be seen in sim tray. 6. Cleverly designed to match the updated look of quad camera phones only with two camera.  Cons:- 1. Can't use net while calling. 2. Camera not upto the mark. 3. Body to screen ratio not optimised. 4. Slow net connectivity. 5....

20670,4,"For a price range of 9k this is a very decent phone without any bloatware. The user interface is very smooth, easy to understand and without any nonsense extra settings like the mi phones.  The phone is highly recommended for the elderly who has very basic usage - YouTube, Spotify, WhatsApp,Google,Camera and any other social media apps. It's not quite smooth for heavy gaming but it works just fine with few lags. So if you're okay with that, go ahead.  Also, the display is well arranged by Mo..."

20686,5,Simply Awesome 1. The quad cam technology which gives the clarity picture of 48MP. 2. The stock android which provides ad-free and bloatware usage of mobile. 3. Long lasting battery. 4. Night vision.

20710,1,"Cons: 1. You can't use internet while you're on a call, that means there's no dedicated inbuilt modems. (These inbuilt modems are pre-installed and are available even on low-end smartphones, never expected this from motorola)  2. The camera's clarity and efficiently is not upto the mark.

Mobile Touch is also good. So if you are looking for good specification phone from 8K-10K, this is nice phone. Go for it..... Request to Moto, they should provide at least phone front screen guard with the mobile."
20749,4,It's good but length is big to hold in hand. Hybrid sim slot is a drawback.. u can put one sim and 1 memory card only. .if u want to put another sim..need to remove one of them.. Gesture mode also there..good some times

20753,5,I bought this phone in the flash sale and it works amazingly. The screen is long and beautiful. It does feel a bit heavy at start but you do get used to it in a day or two. The camera works quite nicely given that this is a budget phone. You get absolutely everything in the least price and a fantastic performance. Go for it.

20803,3,"The look of the phone could have been more better by keeping screen sixe to 5.8, could have been slim if reduce the battery to 3500. The back camera design with mate kinda finish is awesome. One of the best phone in this prize range."
20804,4,"First of all i was suprised because it was more than the size which i expected.. And the display keep justice to the price. Battery : once its full charged it will last for a full day. Eventhough its a normal charger but works decently Camera : spot colur option is unique, portrait mode works well at day light, night capture is above avarge Overall expercice is worth for the money if u are looking for a budgetfull fun with some needfull features go for it"

20813,5,Camera clarity like 8mp. Nice products
20814,4,the product is a good budget phone for casual work and not heavy games. you can play heavy games but that would shorten the life of your device. if youre on a tight budget and want a phone for your daily work then it is for you. Hardcore gamers stay away. Camera is decent but the stock android feel and no bloatware is definitely a huge thumbs up for motorola.

Really good with respect to all delivered hardware and software features. BUT...  Disadvantage: 1] The UI accessibility is not user friendly. The UI accessibility is really good in Redmi mobiles - MIUI. The Moto should make the UI like that.  2] The length of the mobile is 6.5 inch. This much size is not needed because it's difficult to keep in the pockets. It...

It Has Amazing 24 Hours Battery Fast Charging Light In Weight Amazing Mic Quality At Last It Has Perfect Sound Quality With Bass And Trebble.
21069,4,The colour is very nice. The driver gets the volume loud but the bass is decent. The magnets are not very strong and the build quality is okay.

21073,4,Let's start with pros and cons Pros: 1.Best in Budget 2.Bass is Good 3.Sound quality is decent 4. Durable design 5.Best battery backup you can get  Cons: 1.Wire is a bit lengthy so they feel so uneasy hanging down you neck to your navel. 2. The greatest disadvantage there is a sound delay while playing PUBG it's like 1 sec sound delay and it matters a lot for players.  All in all What do you think you can get in 1000 it's more than enough in thousand rupees And the company can easily work on...
21074,4,I am being using the Boat Rocerzz 255F for more than 1.5 years and bought this classic collar but after using those for more than year there is much difference in the built quality of Rocerzz has every thing better the sound quality of mivi is (average) considered to Rocerzz . Will recommend buying boat instead of mivi
21075,5,If you are looking for a neckband in this range then this is definitely a good pick for the price. The sound output is best considering the price. The likeable feature is the battery backup. It's pretty good.
21076,5,Only some points i will say : Use correct silicon tips for better noise cancellation : Sound quality also depends on which platform do you listen like youtube and spotify have not same music quality on same music.... Overall good package under 1000 rs.
21077,5,Definitely a great product. Design and build quality is really good and so is the bass of this neckband. Really loud yet the sound is really crisp. What makes it really a best recommendation is that it is priced below Rs 1000 and comes in so many colour options. Go for it without a second doubt!

21178,1,"Its very bd sound quality , too long wire , plastic quality also bad"
21179,2,My left ear piece is making crackle noise other than that sound quality is good 1.Bass is ok not for bass lovers 2.Mid's is best for the price. 3.Best performance is at 60 to 70 % of volume above that music gets a bit rough 4.Best in quality . 5.only for melody songs. Returned only for that crackle noise from Left ear piece

And I don't think it gives 24hrs of battery ,it gives somewhere around 13-14hrs at 70-80% roughly when connected with 2 devices. It has a little bit large earbuds compared to others when you see boat but when you wear it ,it feels like the exact same I bought it for Rs800 , so it is value for money otherwise I will suggest boat 100 wireless is better than this in every aspect except for fast charging"

21523,2,Some distrub in headset
21524,4,Overall a good neckband.. easily gives a backup of near abt 24hrs of avarage usage being honest...light weight...the only thing that bothers me is this has a heavy kind of sound like with more bass but overall a good choice
21525,3,"Earphone is nice, but volume is not that up to mark. Battery backup is good. But want some more bass ans sound so enjoy the music."
21526,5,Good product..
21527,4,"The 1st mention must be the battery backup. It's truly great in this price. 5/5  Bass treble and sound quality is good enough for classes. But not enough for Music lover or a moviemaniac. 3.5/5  Build quality is also good enough and the flat wire give it a decent look. 4/5  Cons- If it was black with little blue/green/Yellow touches, it would be great.  Overall 4.5/5. 4.5 just because of this much quality in such a lower price (755 rs)"
21528,4,"Overall good but feels loose in ears, may fall off while running"

21768,4,good
21769,4,"Quality of the sound is not worth even Rs.299 earphones are better than this, problems : base is overpowering treble and other sounds i.e., optimization of sound is not done properly and for base lovers you can go for it but for pure song lovers its not worth it"

PROUD TO USE INDIAN BRAND‚ù§Ô∏è."
21776,5,Best neckband in market that mivi ever made .it has high quality of sound and high bass .its battery backup is pretty good.
21777,5,Don't worry for the quality all these things are very good All the best
21778,5,Fabulous
21779,1,Didn't support my redmi note 8 ‚òπÔ∏è.... It had very low volume when I paired to my mobile I ordered it because i thought it's indian brand.. but didn't supporterd... It supoerted to moto g8 lite very well ü§ü

21792,5,It Feels Like The Money I Paid Reflects A Good Image üëç
21793,1,Don't buy...chip product
21794,1,Battery backup 2-3 h only
21795,5,Overall it's an amazing deal for 899. Though the sound quality is not that much great but it justifies the price with good performance. I have tried to charge it using my fast charger but even after charging for 6 hours it never fully charged. I tried this twice but same result. Calling quality and voice clarity is decent. The other party can hear your voice clearly along with a little background noise. Overall I can say it's a good option not the best in this price range.
21796,1,Don't buy
21797,4,Veryy bad qwality
21798,4,Good üòä
21799,3,Mivi has do a lot of improvement in their products Because sound quality for music is the best of this Bluetooth earphones but sound quality is low when we are watching YouTube videos and noise cancellation is not that much great
21800,1,It's not able to connect calls
21801,5,Nice Product
21802,3,After using for a week :- I don't like it that much. Sound quality is very low. You will hardly hear anything at medium volume. For me 80% volume gives an average sound. Even the battery drains faster. It sometimes gets disconnected on its own. Overall not happy with this purchase.
21803,5,Super
21804,1,"Useless product we can hear music, but calls we can't hear any voice , we need to speak via phone speaker only."

21832,4,"Built and battery quality is very very good! Sound quality is clear but if you're bass lover then don't buy it because their their is very low baas! Overall sound quality is pretty good. Battery backup is excellent, if you use normal then you archive 4- 5 days battery and roughly use then this is gives you 3-4 days battery connectivity is splend, overall I loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
21833,4,It always remain strained if you put in your ear while hanging in your collar. Otherwise product is overall perfect. The sound is little bit slow but has a good bass comparison to sound. Magnetic power is low not able to hold together.
21834,4,Good one

22042,4,This is good for online calling . But for songs not a great choice . When the base increases it feels like the vocals are suppressed . But we purchased it for online lectures only and it does a great job for it. If anyone wants for music I have boat rokerz 510 . They are best for everything.
22043,5,Best neckband with reasonable price
22044,5,"Good, but it is uncomfortable to wear"
22045,3,Thanks

22050,4,Good Product and battery backup is awesome..
22051,3,Not bad in this price segment
22052,3,Reviewing this product after two days of usage. Previously I was using boat neckband. Tried this product after seeing positive reviews and also for being make in india. But I am somewhat disappointed with the build quality in first impression. It feels cheap as compared To basic boat neckband. Sound quality is also not that great. I charge it for almost 7-8 hrs. Still it's showing 90%charged.
22053,4,"Nice product ,light weight and flexible for cary."
22054,4,to good headset highly recommended

22180,3,Not satisfied
22181,5,Best headphone
22182,3,Not 10mtr range..only 5mtr. Bt sound is good
22183,4,Fantastic
22184,5,Best neckband under 999
22185,1,It stopped working after two months. More so there was zero noise cancellation. I use to get a teaching sound in between. Waste of money
22186,3,Good product
22187,5,Awesome product
22188,5,Nice product and flipkart deliver very fast this product
22189,5,Very nice product and supportive delivery agent
22190,4,Good
22191,5,Awesome
22192,4,Sound is clear and upto the mark. Volume is not that too loud but i think it's balanced and comfortable to use for a long time. Bass is good at 70-80% volume. Battery backup is excellent. It lasts 15-17 hr on one time charge if using mid volume. Battery backup depends on the use and volume. Overall value for money in this price.
22193,4,Good but due to some issue when riding on a bike it will stop playing music or stops functioning
22194,1,Not good..
22195,5,Best I am satisfied with this mivi collar classic neckband And sound quality ? Battery Backup ?
22196,3,"Not satisfied with quality, no noise cancellation also."
22197,5,Value for money product with impressive sound quality
22198,5,"Great ? product with 1year warranty Sound, bass, calling, battery ? backup also too good Thank you flipkart for this type of service ? keep it up"
22199,5,Good.
22200,5,Mivi callar classik neckband is amezing.. And good battery beckup. I like this product..
22201,5,Very good product
22202,5,Wonderful product !! Amazing !! ???
22203,5,Nice product
22204,5,Excellent sound quality
22205,5,Best products
22206,5,Nice ??
22207,5,Best quality products
22208,5,So nice this is my first mivi products ..jai carry minati..
22209,4,Sound is not up to mark and battery backup is more or less 13-15 hrs
22210,2,Good sound quality but making issues while using 2 apps at same time or while video calls sound breaks and when video call comes than i have to disconnect and connect again to get sound in the lead otherwise lead is connected and sound comes from phones speakers not in collars.
22211,3,Sound is not up to mark it's low even on high volume
22212,5,Superb quality
22213,5,Superb superb superb
22214,5,Good
22215,3,Great product but removing 2 stars because the mivi customer care keeps pestering regarding leaving a review on Flipkart. They get your number by messaging them to claim warranty but actually it's just a ploy to get the customer's phone number.
22216,1,After 1 month stop working and I can't any type of contact with mivi service quality is very poor
22217,1,Broken and used
22218,1,"After one month usage, Battery gets draining from 50% to 0% within 10 minutes...."
22219,5,"This was a surprise birthday gift for my sister. and she is super happy with this. The fast delivery is incredible, I received it within 24 hours of ordering. excellent sound quality and calling experience. crystal clear mic."
22220,5,Nice quality and good price
22221,5,Base and sound quality good. Design not good
22222,3,Cons Bluetooth range is weak Disconnected many times automatically Felt the earphone cable is too long Pros Sound and built quality is good Made in India product Reasonable price Battery backup is good
22223,5,Under 1000 neckband mivi collar classic is one of the best The bass of this earphone is better than Realme buds according to me Sound quality is also good But wire is too long
22224,4,Nice product
22225,5,Good product
22226,5,Ok
22227,5,If you want to buy this to listen to music then don't. Bluetooth can never beat Wired ones when it comes to raw audio quality. For casual purposes I haven't found any flaws. There's no time lag when watching videos. Battery backup is pretty good. You can surely binge 10+ hours of content.
22228,5,It's definitely a value for money product. The most important thing is it's battery life and the sound quality is decent and it's very good to take calls mic work very well. Design is not so good feels heavier.
22229,5,Excellent quality üëç and battery backup is also nice üëç
22230,4,Very well
22231,3,Sound quality 2.4 out of 5 Bass 3.9 out of 5 Bulild quality awesome 4.6 out of 5. Connectivity good üëç. This product is not justify the price. overall average product but it's a Made In India product so if you interested in this product you can buy it.
22232,4,Value for Money. Over all quality is excellent. #1 to buy in this price segment
22233,4,Good product at this price.
22234,5,will recommend people who want battery backup with good sould quality that to at a reasonable worth cost .. have been using this for past 15-20 days really liked the sound quality and multiple connectivity device feature ...
22235,4,Good
22236,3,Sound is not so much that you can easily talk with other noise and connectivity is also keep changing to only audio /media or call mode
22237,5,The best value for money most important part of this earphone in battery backup and fast charging and also sound also best üëçüèª
22238,5,It is useful for my online classes
22239,4,Good
22240,5,Please go for it guys... Bass and sound quality is upto the mark but battery backup and build quality is excellent.
22241,2,Average quality
22242,3,Sound is not good bass quality so poor

22259,5,Amazing bass and also sound But not good for gaming like BGMI Battery backup also very very good
22260,4,Working good
22261,5,Nice product
22262,3,"The product is good if you haven't used any expensive products. If compared with realme buds or realme wired, the sound quality of this is average. Don't expect too much bass. One can definitely use this for general media consumption.  One more thing, even though it gets connected to my laptop, I have been facing sound breaking from earphones when connected to my laptop. Don't know why."
22263,5,Awesome üëçüëçüëç
22264,4,Aweaome product like it
22265,2,Sounds low
22266,5,This product is very comfortable and very smooth sound system
22267,5,Bass is enough . Sound Quality is superb and if you have usage of approximately 10-12 hrs it's battery can last for Two Days
22268,5,over all performance was good

22303,5,Sound clarity suppar totally products wreygood
22304,5,"It's good but it's not playable in game. Music, YouTube, movies play time is osm. I suggest you you can buy mivi coller classic neckband. Battery backup is 1 week Charges complete in 30 -40 minute"
22305,4,Nice
22306,5,Best product
22307,4,"sound is little bit low, bass is good"

22312,4,On a call noise cancellation not working
22313,5,"Bought at 999, but i bet it is the best buy in 1500 budget. V shaped sound signature with bass and treble boosted but not overpowering. I would say it's the best earphone that can be used to listen all type of music, like rock, pop, classical, oldies and it really a perfect balanced music out put.  Those who say it produces less bass, I think they don't care for music, rather they need some thing which just makes only boom boom nothing else.  Battery back up is good and best part is the fast..."

22320,4,The earphones are truly awesome ..they fit in the ear too well and are very comfortable . For me it goes over 2 days in one charge . The base is quiet decent and I am very happy with the product. You can go for it without any problem.
22321,5,Make in India
22322,2,Battary pack is not good But other design build is good sound quality is good
22323,5,"Best product under 1000 rs, just go for it, specially bass lover, for runner it very good"
22324,4,Nice product...
22325,4,Overall It's A value For Money Product But The Only Drawback Is It Picks ups toomuch Background Noise. If you Are walking on road n talking with someone on call the other person will get too much Disturbance but other than that it's Very Nice
22326,5,One of the best product by mivi Battery life is awesome and calling experience is very good and finally I am loving it
22327,5,Worth buying it... Must go for it...ü•∞‚ú®üåà

22348,3,Bast parice in the market All over compare to other products its very high good product. Battery backup is asome
22349,5,Looking good but its not good
22350,5,Best product in this range! You can blindly buy this
22351,1,earbuds does not comfortable in ear. product return policy is not flexible. it is monopoly of flipkart.
22352,4,Everything is really good according to its price except 2 things.....first one is the magnets which are really loose and cannot even stick when the earbuds are near to each other....and second one is the annoying battery low reminder though it already has 20% of battery left....pls by making an app push an update and reduce the reminder to 10%
22353,5,MIVI IS BEST THIS PRICE POINT ü•∞ü•∞
22354,1,One month of buying this product one of his mic is stop working. I m disappointed from this product. Never expected this kind of working.

22699,3,Good Product but it is not best. If you can spend 200 more you will get better Boat product. Battery life goes feom 100 to 50 slowly then it discharges too fast. Overall it is good to use but not the best you can expect. Not Value for money.

22814,5,Good product
22815,4,I have been heavily using this device from the day of it's delivery. No problem have been identified by me till now.  I usually study using online method and I am satisfied by the sound quality of the device. The mic is good but it also catches the distant sounds which makes it little annoying.  Buttons feedback is good and it feels premium.  Battery backup is a bit concern as it dropped from 50% to 20% in a matter of an hour. At/below 20% it periodically keeps announcing Battery low and it...
22816,2,I thought MIVI collar classic is the best product which made in india but I'm disappointed by the price and the product sound quality is soo low.. In this price I bought boult brand thats gives me high value and satisfaction.. So please do some improvement. Which you describe made in india
22817,4,Dont think Buy it
22818,4,"1. Fast charging 2. Good battery life around 24 hours with high usage 3. Moderate bass 4. Mediocre mic quality, not great. 5. On high volume, somewhat creeky voice 6. Plastic build no metal  If you are getting mivi duopods m20 at similar price point, go for it."

22942,5,Considering the price point this is one of the best neckband you can get..The best thing about this is Cristal clear mic and great battery life.
22943,5,Loving this üíôüíô
22944,3,Headphone cables are not soft and flexible. So it falls in between.
22945,5,"Nice product, thank you Mivi."
22946,1,This is pathetic. I have samsung A50 phone and it's not at all working I'm my phone. I want to return and get the refund as well but till now I have not even got any assistance yet. Not at all worthy.
22947,1,Very bad quality products don't buy it
22948,3,Cheap Quality
22949,4,I bought it in 699 using student advantage and Flipkart pay latter but the price is slightly high it will not 999 but actually it's price should be 699. the build quality should increase the button is slightly tight . .and should give aac Audi or Qualcomm aptex technology for better sound quality and low latency. And should mivi make product with magnetic control like in OnePlus bullet wireless z bass edition or touch control in blutooth wired headset Proudly made in india Fast charge
22950,5,Really it's good quality Earphones with perfect long lasting battery life and amazing sound quality. It is one of the best quality earphone in this range .
22951,5,"Great product for the very reasonable price, you will not be disappointed. These are perfect talking on the phone or listeng to music during a workout. The volume is really good, base is nice too and for the price these are a steal. Get the expensive ones for when you want awesome concert sound quality but for really good sound and just to chill out, these are the ones, and so enjoyable. They fit it your ear super comfy too which is important to me. Enjoy!!"

22968,4,"Apart from not so good build quality, the earphone has descent sound quality and an excellent battery backup. If you are looking for a budjet friendly earphone this will be a happy purchase for you. And also the earphone charges from 0 to 100% in just 40minutes and gives a battery backup of 24 hr ish at 70%. I haven't measured the exact time. But ya it lasts a decent 3 to 4 days for my usage."

Sound quality is ok as per price range. Build quality feels solid. Overall value for money. Used just for 2 days, let's see how it goes after 3-6 months."
22980,4,"Decent product considering the price point, I'd say one of the best at Rs. 1K! Detail for Gamers: I felt an Audio Latency (Lag) of around 150-300 ms; so yeah, not really for gaming."

23126,1,The sound is not stable after one week. Waste of money
23127,3,I expected much more from mivi but when you unbox it you can figure it out that its actually made in india because the packing quality and headphones built quality is average or you can say below average. Headphones are made of full low quality plastic. Magnetic power is not so that good. If you want any cheap headphones and good sound you can go for it.

After it it's battery was drained total I use it 13 hr with 90% battery. After 50% it was drain very fast within a hour it was drained from 50% to 0% . I use generally only to attend call and only 2hr. Play song.  Sound is good not best but in this prize range it is worth.  Faces some problem during call like some times...

Bass is high but I think this much bass is not needed because base the really required base is low, and the bass overwhelms and affects mids and highs. My previous wired headset Boat bassheads produce better result as it has more base and balanced sound. Still it is recommended because you can adjust equalizer to get better output.

24079,1,"Actually sound quality is horrible, i don't expect it."
24080,5,"MIVI Collar classic is the only budget friendly product which comes with all the necessary features that fulfill an audio lover's demand and can't afford a premium earphone. It costs just minimum and has excellent audio quality, some premium features that actually work, a good battery life, water proof, 24hr battery and more.Just in love with earphones . Thanks mivi üëç"
24081,5,"I recently bought this neckband. It pretty cool. Well packaging, light in weight and with good backup. The sound quality is also nice.  Sound üëç Backup üëç Packaging üëç  Loved it!!"
24082,1,Very disappointed by mivi and the Flipkart.. poor quality of headphones.. volume up button not working properly.. mic has very poor quality.. i got faulty piece
24083,5,Best quality. It's sound is too clear and loud. It battery backup is also good. I am using it since 3 days. Amazing performance.
24084,5,It has a really good bass and sound and when listening and it also has active noise cancellation.
24085,2,When I buy earphone there button is not working properly because when I increase the volume then the button automatically decrease and when I decrease that it not work properly that I return it don't buy for pubg very delay button doesn't work properly my advice that don't but this collar ear buy mivi duo pods m20 is better that mivi collar one!!!
24086,5,Wow this is an amazing headset. I have used many headphone but this one is the best i ever used. Its not only charge fast but also looks classic. And compared to the price the sound is very nice the bass is amazing and the high and the mids are also great the charging speed is fast too.

24090,5,Mivi is one of the best brands out there They are budget friendly as well as an india brand These mivi collar are just great They have really good audio quality and bass too It charges really quickly So go for it!
24091,5,Is good
24092,5,Quality of sound and base is great. The best thing it's battery backup. It last upto 4 days. Best at this price. Most important it's an indian brand.
24093,5,Nicely built design which very comfortable to wear. Very light weight and amazing battery backup. The sound quality is very clear and base is on point. It's dust and splash proof feature is very helpful for my workout . Overall I'm fully satisfied with the Mivi bluetooth earphone.
24094,5,The earphones r soo good the bass is awesome the packing of the box is also good If anyone is looking for earphones under 1000 go for it blindly it's awesome ...... And battery backup is also good I keep charging before 3 days and still the battery is 90percent after using also
24095,3,It's good in sound quality and its bass is also very good. Mivi Collar Classic is a Classic Product which is valueable for those who desire to listen good music in wirelessly. But it's magnetic strength of earphones is very weak which I think company should improve in the near future or next model launch.

25902,2,Genuine review after using the headset for 1 week. Very average head set. Just works if u want a earphone for time being or as a backup / spare Call quality is okay. Music quality is just okay. Don't expect clarity at this price. Better to pay 100 extra and go fo a better one like Boult or boat.

26108,4,"Material quality isn't that good, it is delicate. Sound and bass is loud but not very clear. Sound and build quality could have been better. If you want to buy an earphone strictly in the budget of 150rs, then you can go for it. It will be like your backup earphone. Otherwise atleast add 50rs in your budget and you can have better earphone like of zebronics."

27001,3,I purchased them in november 2020 and they died in March 2021. So unless you aren't desperately in need of ear phones invest in better ones.  Sound quality : clear & good Wire length : too short Ear plugs quality: worst (scratchy in a way) (so I added different one to them) Life : shorter than you want. Cost: cheap and agreeable  I chose it cause was needing one and this was affordable and cheap. You choose wisely.

If you are planning to buy any of these then here is my review :  1) Ubon GPR-411 : If you listen music/ watches movie & does casual gaming this earphone is best. Pros : Most balanced sound.

27221,3,Product is usable but do not expect too good sound and bass quality at this price. The build quality is poor so you need to be very carefull while using it.
27222,2,Till one month it worked osm but after that not working properly but sound is ok cables are loose connection
27223,5,Great
27224,1,Bad earphones
27225,1,Worst quality
27226,4,"I got it for Rs.171/- and at this price the product is at its best. nice sound and very light weight. it claims extra bass but it also depends on your mobile and the music app you are using. It also matters the bass or equalizer setting of the app. so, it's a nice product and if it lasts for even six months, I would be happy because how much you can expect when you spend just Rs.171/-? ...and after five months, one speaker has stopped working."
27227,5,Nice product

30175,3,"Overall the look and the features are good, however I would like to highlight a few issues that I am facing.  The notifications do not appear, calls sometimes appear sometimes they don't, on the other hand inspite of linking the notifications for the msgs, the same is not working.  Battery backup is decent enough to sustain for three full days. The maps don't work properly, there is a lot of dependency on a good internet connection, but to what I understand the watch is connected with Blueto..."
30176,5,"Looks sleek, very comfortable to wear and yet to test it out for accuracy during walking or cycling my two main exercises but I feel it's a purchase which will be very satisfactory.  After using the watch for a while I can assure you its a brilliant product and has very good accuracy when it comes to covering step counts, calories burnt as well as heart rate. Sleep tracking is very good too and the fitbit app is excellent."
30177,5,I wasn't a great fan of activity monitors but the one thing that interested me to go for fitbit versa is i can load lots of songs and can go for my daily jogging with out needing to carry my phone. I connect my wireless ear buds with out any hassle. I'm not a fitness freak but once I got used to the activity monitor the data is helping me to be more active in the day. the fun part for me is to try hundreds of different free watch faces that suit to your taste. does everything that's mentione...
30178,5,"fitbit versa is looking absolutely great !!! No doubt at all.All features are good but payments were not supported for Indian version, hoping to get payment option soon. Best product at its cost range."
30179,4,Great product for the amount paid. Got it for 7999. Its amazing and works very well. It can even measure oxygen level. Thank you for such an amazing product.
30180,5,watch is really good....i found very useful to track my activity....quality and built great for this price point...suggest to buy the watch below 15k whenever there is any offer....because then the value for money could be felt satisfactory
30181,5,Excellent product. Worth buying it. I personally suggest not to go for higher version for beginners who are planning to buy a smart watch. Apart from other cheap brands and entry level smart watches Fitbit Special Edition is best in looks and performance as well.
30182,4,"Overall a good product as it looks and feels good on my wrist.  Pros 1. Looks good and stylish 2. Has plenty of apps that can be downloaded using the mobile app 3. Vibration with notification is very strong  Cons 1. Syncing with the app takes a while sometimes 2. I was not able to transfer music to the built in music app even when the watch was connected to a wifi 3. Even riding a scooter counts as steps, which is ridiculous"
30183,4,"Great value at this price point, though I was expecting little more battery power along with few basic features like spo2, stress meter etc which are missing.  The music section required a paid version of Spotify and again the watch won't itself play. Ut you would need to carry your phone along with watch with paid version of Spotify to just manage the control. I personally don't find this useful because if I have to carry the phone than I can mange the control from my phone of bluetooth ear..."
30184,5,I ordered the peach color watch and it looks great the watch is rose gold and strap is peach colored. looks great on wrist and has good features.. setting up and configuring was smooth. Till now no issues per se. Delivery was fast and without glitch. Product was also defect free.
30185,3,not worth for money... couldn't able to get music /songs as specified.. no synch established for whattups.. calendar after all attempts post spending good time.. not worth to buy...
30186,4,"i am using this watch more than one month watch is good really helpful for those who are health consious . watch is looking perfect , heart rate sensor is also fine , tracking is also gud but one thing i feel about this is its screen .it is so small we are habitual of large screen and this watch has little screen u think fitbit should work on this ..and it straps and screen gurads also so expensive"
30187,4,I would have liked to give a 3.5 stars but there's no option here! okay so now the watch:- The watch is grt in terms of fitness related features like tracking and stuff!! my main use of the watch was to use it like an smartwatch. it works like half smartwatch at the most that i can say! Though it has great features the main problem that i faced was while connecting it to my phone (honor play) it frequently drops the Bluetooth connection every now and then!
30188,5,very beautiful smart watch.. and works perfectly..... this is my third Fitbit in family and from last 5 years we have been a part of Fitbit family..... no complain....I don't see the point of wasting so much money on apple watch when the same work is done and beside you won't need a apple cellphone to sync it is compatible with any operating system...... value for money..... only first syncing one feel takes 5 min rest it just glided
30189,4,"This is a very good watch I am giving this review after using it for one week, it looks nice display is good data I felt the data is pretty accurate. I got it during the sale and the price which I got it was worth taking it, however I was not sure that this watch is not compatible with all the devices. Before buying this watch I would recommend that you go to the website of fit bit and find the list of compatible device for Versa and then only buy it. No wonder thatYou may have to buy a phone..."
30190,5,I will divide this in pros and cons. Pros : 1. Screen brighten is good. 2. All the values shown by watch is appropriate. 3. Extra straps were good. 4 . Overall give you feeling of very premium watch. 5. I got it for 7500 so price is excellent. Cons: 1. Battery backup is not that much good (3 days).
30191,4,"Surprised to get delivery from Flipkart within 2 days. Thanks Flipkart.. Really a good quality product from fitbit with accuracy in each function. Easy to operate OS, Crisp and clean display along more functions for a fitness lover makes this product a worth buy."
30192,1,PLZZ read this before Wasting your money. PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Flipkart. They are not ready for return process even if your product is worst. Flipkart is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy headache and problems then go there. Don't waste your time with Flipkart  Regarding Fitbit Versa Performance is very worst. Which is atomatically disconnected from the app and then act as a simple digital watch. Flipkart customer care to take thi...
30193,5,"My wife wanted a smart watch which could guess the hours of deep sleep and also count her exercise minutes, she does different HIIT forms. I was a bit skeptical before buying it but she ABSOLUTELY loved it. This was an anniversary gift and i still hear of it."
30194,4,Every day I am falling in love with this versa... only concern is battery it doesn‚Äôt lasts more than 3 days.
30195,4,wonderful product
30196,3,Used it for 4 days now its time to tell the pros n cons.Step counter is absolute fail. I had to ride 23km to work and it counted 2300 steps along with stats of climbing 29 floors which was hilarous. heart sensor works good. vibration is adeqaute to notify calls ans other notifications. dial size is too small those who are big guns consider trying it out on retail shops before buying it.. Wallet app doesnt seems to be availabe in India so NFC payment feature you can forget it. The app sto...
30197,5,awesome.
30198,1,Just don't waste your money on this idiotic product..it will make your life hell cos it will stop notifying you time and again..and only option to resolve it is reinstalling the app..you will end up doing it 3-4 times a day..bad just bad.
30199,1,I had ordered 2 watches but returned both of them. This watch is good but FitBit android application is very bad no proper syncing and had a lots of problems with notifications. If someone is purchasing smartwatch then without notification and proper syncing its just a digital watch why will someone waste so much money on a stupid digital watch.
30200,4,Worth the price... does all it claims to do...and does it well
30201,5,good
30202,5,"Yes, it is the best fitness tracker watch. Data is accurate. Yes GPS is missed, but you can carry your cell phone along while running or jogging. The tracker and App does get the job done. Display as they say is amazing, no matter how sunny is the light outside, you can view your info. People who want to track their fitness goal, I would suggest go for it."
30203,1,FitBit Stopped Working after 6 months of use. Doesnt connect to IOS or Android. Tried everything. Wasted all my investment on this watch!!
30204,4,Nice product nice batter life colour quality is very poor but Look's primium....
30205,3,steps are not accurate ..may be you have to half fold the count
30206,5,Wow great one i loved it totally
30207,4,The fitbit is good. A price around 6k would be better for this I think. although I do not think spo2 sensor is there in the device. The description is wrong.  Not a right practice to advertise something which is not there in the product. Should be changed or fix the product.
30208,5,Good to go watch . Quite light Weight
30209,5,"It is indeed an amazing fitness watch considering the price and all the features offered with it. And the extra straps are really useful, I had to buy aftermarket straps for my blaze after 2 years of use, but with the versa SE you will get total 3pare of strap including the one allready installed. And decent delivery by flipkart."
30210,4,Great watch to wear üëå
30211,4,1. U can listen to music through your Bluetooth headset 2. Takes approximately 30min to setup on wifi 3. Connect same wifi with phone and watch 4. For music upload in watch u have to download app in your laptop and select transfer music option in watch and wait to connect .Then just simply drag and drop songs and sync with watch 5. U have to take ur mobile while running because it has connected gps 6. U cant connect ur Bluetooth headset and watch together in Vivo z1pro 7. U have to on ur m...
30212,2,"Received duplicate straps (Belt) within 6 to 8 month both belts cut down automatically..... Watch is good, belt cost is 3k...."
30213,5,Loved it
30214,1,"BPM feature is not working, wifi is not getting connected, notification feature fails"
30215,1,they gave used product
30216,4,it's good.
30217,5,nice smartwatch..
30218,4,"Got it for 10,999 rs. Major problem with this is ""notification"" it never showed notification on my oneplus 6 phone. Highly disappointed!! rest everything is fine"
30219,1,"Changing opinion from 4 star to 1 star. After using it for one year, it stopped counting step, heartbeat & motion sensor stopped working, contacted it's CC they told me to factory reset it & again do setup, after doing the same for 10 time no change occurred, now watch is not starting & charging, after contacting they told me that your warranty is over & they suggest me to buy a new one, never expected such poor quality from world famous fitbit."
30220,1,"First it's not functioning properly. To be particular, i don't get notifications on phone properly. Two when I compare them with the watch which my friend purchased in US. It looks like replica. There is been alot of variance in quality."
30221,1,"the Bluetooth is very poor, synchronization gets disconnected very frequently, step count is also inccurate, app is very confusing, waisted my money, this is my last purchase from Fitbit"
30222,4,Good Product
30223,3,Amazing product but prize is very high. Coming to performance is above average Overall product is good ‚ò∫Ô∏è
30224,5,Nice product
30225,3,The connected phone notifications rarely work on this watch. Cannot see the messages nor the incoming calls. I have seen similar issue with charge 2. Tried every possible troubleshooting option suggested but couldn't resolve it.
30226,1,Not supporting for Notifications.
30227,4,Device looks and feels good. It functions well.  But...  Does not pair well with MI A3 device. Please make sure that you check their website for the list of phones that it can sync up well.
30228,2,Good product without any questions. Free apps are available up to date.
30229,4,Really liked this watch ‚ò∫Ô∏è
30230,4,nice watch but have issues with bluetooth connectivity. but still overall one can have it as a beginner.
30231,1,very pathetic watch only after two weeks of use its now showing blank screen and above all no service centre in India
30232,3,first check your mobile compatibility before purchasing one..Redmi not 5 Pro not compatible
30233,4,Happy to buy it in billion sale
30234,1,not support all mobile model
30235,1,Do not buy...not worth and they fool us saying no refund..warning in 1week watch glass will break if it thouch any wall or drop..for this cost and brand they should have improved the quality and more functions. so please don't buy and get fooled
30236,5,Awesome Smart Watch At This Budgets 4 Day's Battery Backup Thankyou Filpkart..!
30237,2,Don't ever buy fitbit watch'. If anything happens after one year they will say that as it is out of warranty so nothing can be done. You may buy if you can invest such a huge amount for one year. My watch is not getting connected with any mobile phone means i thing bluetooth is not working. Its better to buy some other watch which is not so costly. On help they says nothing can be done as it is not getting connected.
30238,4,this fitbit versa is awesome... i am using this snartwatch from last 15 days and I loved it... all functions are very good and accurate... only problem I had in the beginning while connecting with phone but now it is part of my daily routine...
30239,5,Got it at an amazing deal for 7.5k during big billion days. Thank you Flipkart.
30240,5,"Awesome product, fully satisfied..great product team fitbit.üëåüôè"
30241,5,It's a good watch.
30242,3,Its not worth buying this watch...you will find wtches in 2-3k which does better job than this
30243,5,"The Versa 1st Generation is still a great bet for those wanting in on the Fitbit ecosystem. It's a no - gimmicks, no - frills smartwatch that does the job well. I got it at a great price during the Flipkart sale."
30244,4,Value for money
30245,2,The quality of Fitbit Versa is not good and I am writing this after using the watch for 1.5 years of limited use.  1. The rubber wrist straps are of poor quality: Cracked after 3 months of usage.  2. Vibration stopped working after 1 year.  3. The accuracy is not that good. My phone's health app is much accurate than this watch.  4. Touch (screen) not very smooth
30246,1,"Worst watch, no activity tracking, don't buy this product"
30247,4,I gifted this to my father on his birthday. He loved it. Its really good.
30248,5,The watch looks good. The connectivity is also pretty good. The designs looks cool too. The only down fall I noticed is that it tracks your step while you are riding bike aur driving car.
30249,3,Just okay
30250,5,Excellent watch.
30251,5,Amazing Amazing Amazing product But battery backup average
30252,3,Some functions not there in actual but was mentioned on product page. The charger seems to be old with whitish texture on top.
30253,2,Connectivity is very loose
30254,5,Good product
30255,1,Most useless product. Will never get connected to bluetooth. Pure waste of money. That's why flipcart is selling it with such discount. Just don't waste your money. Super useless watch
30256,5,Good product... resonable price...
30257,5,"Cool looks and good for technosavvy people!! Keeps records of heart rate, steps and many more, has bluetooth accessibility to all ur apps in the phone üìû. Displays all notifications and calls!!"
30258,1,"Once u lock ur device , and simultaneously unpair your device from mobile then u can never unlock that device for life time"
30259,5,Excellent Fitbit for the price If you are looking for your first smart watch it a best choice Battery lasts more than 3 days Display is great Accuracy is near to perfect My experience first update is done by calling customer care which is also in Fitbit app which Is of great easy I like the most is we can add our photos as watch face with all info such as time heart rate etc
30260,3,The display glass of the watch is not worth the money. I have been using various watches all through my life. Right from HMT to Fossil. But this is the first time I bought a watch that chipped at the edges with just a light tap against the door frame. I have now worn a silicon screen protector. Also the strap broke in two months. One good fact is I got 4straps with this watch. Will never buy Fitbit watches again. Plain health bands are good but not watches .
30261,1,Very bad product. Don't buy it.
30262,2,I can not fix silicone black strap to the dail. Their is no notifications on watch and i am facing problems because of this
30263,5,"A gr8 watch with best discounts from Flipkart and fast delivery. Fitbit is the most reputed name in smart watches with accurate heart rate, sleep & spo2 tracker."
30264,5,Very nice
30265,5,This watch was Awesome
30266,5,Truly outstanding except the battery. The looks is superb.
30267,2,Don't buy this product none of the feature is not working in this product and waste of money
30268,5,Worth buying it
30269,5,It is a good product in this price range.
30270,3,Facing issue with connectivity and notifications access on mobile.
30271,1,"The Fitbit is not getting charged at all since last 2 days. Earlier on 25th April also same issue was faced, when we kept it on the charger for few hours and after few hours it started charging. But since last 2 days it not getting charged at all. We tried various options like putting the usb charger in laptop and differ power points but no avail. The quality of the product sent is really questionable. Poor quality product has been sent by dealer."
30272,1,"Worst product to buy, waste of money. after all the attempt to fix the sync issue it failed to do so. Bought an expensive new phone just to be compatible but still facing the same issue."
30273,1,Pathetic smartwatch. Displays wrong distances. Too much error in all features. Don't buy. Waste of money
30274,5,It's an amazing product
30275,2,"The Fitbit distance calculation is wrong. Eg:: when I walk a particular distance it shows 1 km, but when you run the same distance it shows 1.4km meters."
30276,3,"The major con is the battery life. If I just wear this the entire day without syncing with phone, even then I need to charge it once in 2 days. The claim of 4 days battery life is total sham. Deducting 2 points for that alone. My older GoQii used to give me a good week's life.  The 2nd major pain in the neck was adding music to the watch. It took a software update for me to realise that I wasn't doing anything wrong, it was a glitch in existing software.  It does a pretty decent job of tracki..."
30277,2,With heartbeat on battery backup is 1+ days Spo2 doesn't work Steps count is not accurate.
30278,2,Poor battery backup
30279,5,Best watch
30280,5,This watch is so good.And I can where it anywhere.
30281,4,Awesome üòé thank you flipkart for service
30282,5,Worth buy and accurate
30283,5,"Except the average battery life of 3-4 days max... It's awesome. Transferring of songs is bit of a hassle as one can only do it thru laptop. Light weight, touch control responsive. Got it for 7999/-. Worth every penny."
30284,2,Bettery keep charging every day
30285,2,After one year display automatically damaged
30286,5,Excellent product... Useful features for a lay person to collect data
30287,1,Worst product no recommended
30288,4,Good watch...looks stylish...
30289,5,Beautiful watch...value for money.
30290,5,Used for about a week now and completely satisfied. Great look and good battery life.
30291,5,Good one
30292,1,"At this price , I could have purchased better product , worst UI"
30293,3,Okay product
30294,5,Thanks flipkart for ontime delivery. Product recieved as described in description. Will write a review after three months if use.
30295,1,The watch stopped working as on March 1st 2021. Never expected this in less than 1.5 years from date of purchase.  Not sure if Flipkart is selling low quality products or the watch itself has an issue.  Either way very disappointed
30296,5,Awsome experience....
30297,5,Good watch
30298,4,"Great smart watch. cool looks. battery life is okay-ish, around 3 days. would love to see SPO2 sensor getting used beyond just sleep data."
30299,1,Unable to reach customer care. The product is not even used for a week now the battery is getting drained in less than 12 hours.
30300,2,Not good
30301,1,Waste of buying
30302,5,Nice watch
30303,5,Very nice product...üëç
30304,4,All good on the accuracy front. Battery life could have been better though .
30305,3,Item is ok bt not supported some apps
30306,1,"Persistent sync issues, pl don't buy"
30307,4,Its a good smart watch with all the necessary features. Highly Recommended
30308,1,Absolutely inaccurate in terms of distance. GPS connection is horrible. If you are looking for sports tracking then better choose Garmin or other chinese brands. Not satisfied with Fitbit's purchase. Wont recommend
30309,1,Very bad experience Connectivity is zero backup also poor
30310,5,Very nice smartwatch in low price!!!
30311,5,"Works great, got delivered on time. Step counter was inaccurate for a bit but nothing you can't fix. The battery lasts for 3-4 days on constant use without notifications. If you have notifications on then it will drain faster. You can't answer calls and texts on this but you do get notification, I personally don't find this feature very useful. Overall decent buy I'd say."
30312,4,All the other features are very good and they are as precise as promised by the brand. The only issue I think is the battery does not last not even for 2 whole days whereas I don't even wear it to my bed.
30313,2,"Incompatible with ios i guess.Sometimes it gets disconnected too. Even I‚Äôm using the latest verions,it shows up to update the app or watch OS to change the clock faces."
30314,5,Superb watch Lots of Clock faces Ok for Activity tracking 2day battery backup only
30315,1,Not good
30316,4,The watch is good. Has good functionality. Battery life is 4 days+. Delivery was fast.
30317,4,Good watch
30318,1,Don't buy.starts malfunctioning after 10 days
30319,1,10k worth product just given to watchman. Did not even ask pin. Product was opened and sealed with cello tape. Are you kidding me? It's a scam second hand product that's why it's cheap. Don't buy.
30320,4,Worth it....
30321,1,Waste.. it's getting hung all the time..not able to complete a workout..
30322,5,Nice
30323,5,Very nice watch in a quite reasonable price. Lots of features. Loving it. Working good.
30324,4,"Nothing can be better than this product , good deal on Flipkart , I will suggest to buy this product without any confusion"
30325,5,Good one if you donot mind connecting to gps of phone. Has 3-4 days of charge. Readings are fairly accurate.
30326,4,Good deal. Amazing! The package had 2 belts as mentioned. bought it at a good discount
30327,5,Great product!!
30328,2,Not value for money..
30329,4,Nice watch
30330,5,Amazing
30331,5,Its value for money
30332,5,Thank you flipkart
30333,2,The batter back isn‚Äôt good also sometimes it fails to light up when you turn you wrist and you can get better options in this price range
30334,3,1.There was a bit of lag in the software response in touch. The step counter had much difference to the negligible value of error. 2. Connected GPS didn't work well either. It was disconnected most time. 3. The wifi connectivity issue with the device was worst. Most of the watch faces were not able to be downloaded. 4. Notification delay 5. One good thing was that the watch is super light and awesome strap (woven fabric) kind. You don't even feel that you've worn it. 6. Detailed sleep analy...
30335,4,It‚Äôs okay
30336,1,"After few months of use, its not starting. Once its out of warranty its of no use if your watch becomes bad as there is no service center. You mail your probz to customer care they will just feel ""sorry for your inconvenience"" and nothing else. It means in short buying such premium smartwatch has a validity of just 1 year. Go for another brand if you wanna buy Premium smart watches. Disappointed with such products from such big brands. Just a loot."
30337,5,Good So far...Loving it
30338,5,Value for money (Accurate results at every point) look is awesome
30339,5,Very good
30340,4,Classic watch
30341,5,Good product
30342,5,It's wow
30343,4,Classy product.but battery issue seen
30344,5,Nice watch.....
30345,4,"It does the same thing what other smart watches does, high price and less features compared with other watches  I have buy fitbit by watching many review and people are talking about accuracy and correction  I am not expert in reviewing the accuracy of the function but yes I am going to buy another smart watches under 2000 and then I can compare and say why other can take fitbit for 24000, such a huge amount.  3Star for the huge prices only rather is fine"
30346,5,"Awsm product at awsm price , Completely satisfactory. Fitibit is the one u can count on"
30347,3,"The watch looks fine but extra strip can't use as it is little bigger then the original one , can you help me to change ...and replace with new strip"
30348,5,Nice
30349,2,Battery was a bit not satisfactory
30350,5,Nice one
30351,3,Pros- Premium quality Brand value Multiple functions Sleek look Good sensitivity  Cons- Display could have been better; one would expect a better display quality looking at the price of the watch and fitbit brand name attached to it. App interface not very good. Couldn't find the used watch faces.
30352,1,Not good at all. I jave returned the product same day.
30353,2,Don't buy
30354,4,"Hardware is good, but lot of premium features in app."
30355,1,The Product was used and the extra strap was missing and the main strap was also broken
30356,2,Not worth buying it ....screen flickering issue
30357,5,Wonderful bought at 7300
30358,4,Got it in Big billion sale. Positives: Very light . Good software from fit bit tracks all activities. Has an additional belt. Con's: Not the latest features. Many priced below have more features. Only basic steps and heart rate. Strap quality doesn't instill confidence. Plastic feel to the tracker. No GPS/Compass.
30359,4,"Nice watch,but no phone notifications to watch.what is the process to do that."
30360,3,Very often syncing issues and bluetooth connection problems as there are 2 bluetooth connections required.I am disappointed the rest of the watch works fine however the software issues just cuts away the feel and purpose of the watch.
30361,4,Delivered on time. Good one. Looks good.
30362,1,"After a year i al writing this review. I did not use the watch for a month since my strap was broken.. i switched on the watch after the month and it never worked. Tried all possible solutions given in youtube and fibit forum but no luck. Buyers never buy this Fitbit product no service, no support and no guarantee. Spend little more and go with Apple or some other brand.  Seriously the worst product i ever used."
30363,1,Within 8 months display issue started and now it's not working at all and no support from either side.
30364,5,I was very doubtful if this was a right choice. Now I would not regret. Received it today. Set it all up for everything.  Loaded about 100 songs and can play via bluetooth speakers. Best part is I am able to connect to my phone and bluetooth headset at the same time. No difference in quality of sound (actually better than mobile. There is no gap between songs.)  A little time consuming to set up but once done its good to go.  The only thing missing would be inbuilt GPS. Its got everything. No...
30365,5,"Good watch good in quality, precision.  But some how it is not allowing me to update the clock faces and the firmware update is not up to the recent one"
30366,5,Best at this price
30367,4,Good Simple watch.
30368,1,"The only function it does is what a fit band does. Then why pay 10 times more. The message notification function doesn't work properly. And gets removed repeatedly making you reset ur device again and again. The call notification works, but u can't answer ur calls as it doesn't have a inbuilt mic or speaker. It's a total waste of money. Total loss. Requesting for a refund. Also before you buy this product please check on fitbit app if it supports ur device."
30369,5,Nice
30370,5,Very nice üëç all features are nice
30371,5,Sweet techy thing to have... And pretty cute...
30372,3,"Battery discharges within 3 days. You need to pay extra for paid subscription to use the features, the features which are usually bundled with watch purchase."
30373,3,Bike/cycle travelling KMs is not giving if phone not carried. Battery life is also not that good.
30374,5,Pros: 1. Accurate 2. Great community 3. Customisation  Cons: 1. Sync is not all that great. Takes time to get sync 2. Battery drains much faster with always on 3. Accessories are costly
30375,1,I bought versa last year and now it gets problem in Bluetooth and service center not found. Even I have reset the versa but some problem persist.
30376,5,"A smartwatch that works perfectly with both android and iOS. Fitbit has nailed it completely with it's Versa range. The design is sleek, very useful for people who are health-conscious and it offers value for money."
30377,2,"It's not good it's not just complete one year and charger is not working and watch belt is also damage according to cost, material is not good"
30378,5,Very nice really good product
30379,1,Worked well for 6 months and then one day while in use heated up. Burnt the wrist because of battery heating issue.
30380,1,Don't purchase fitbit brand because this is Chinese product. My fitbit watch stopped working after 6 month as well they don't want to exchange.
30381,5,No doubt... It's best in class
30382,5,Good one
30383,1,After 45 days of use my watch stopped working.. it has been 4 months but my watch is not replaced. No response from customer care. Very bad experience.
30384,5,"Except for logistical delay, everything else was perfect for this pick"
30385,3,Not much as expected
30386,5,Best smartwatch in this prive segment. Period. ...
30387,5,Best in class
30388,1,Worst don't buy it
30389,1,Strap is not durable. Broken within three months of usage. Please do not buy from this seller.
30390,1,This product waste
30391,1,Waste of money . Won't work after 6 months.
30392,1,Waste of money.. doesn't connect easily
30393,1,Do not buy this watch.Waste product.Im unable to sync with my phone.Very pathetic customer support too ..
30394,2,Not worth of the price
30395,1,syncing problem with iphone
30396,5,Amazing watch!
30397,2,"Using since months, watch is okay ok okay but the notifications are not working. Tried all the settings they are sync for some time and got disconnected again. Not sure. Upto fitness tracker I was satisfied."
30398,1,Poor
30399,1,"Bought this in July, calorie counting is like wayyyyyy off it literally shows you more than double calories. I mean who burns 7000 calories after a 6 hour walk.  Edit: Horrible, stopped syncing after 3 months of usage fitness tracking was average but calorie tracking was horrible. No customer support in India. I got and Samsung watch 3 which works like a charm and is overall very accurate in terms of fitness tracking. Don't buy fitbit ever."
30400,5,The watch Is good every thing fine but within 6 months the strap snapped. It was used with utmost care but still the strap just tore.
30401,3,Breakage product
30402,1,The worst thing ever i got in my life. I would rather give minus star rating
30403,4,Watch is undoubtedly good. But the strap is not upto the mark... It tore apart in 4 months
30404,1,Very bad watch charging problem accessories problem and customer care not supported for your problem.zero marking
30405,2,"i bought this watch just bcoz im a fitness enthusiast and wanted to track all the daily routines including my phone notification. after 4 days of using this watch notifications of my phone (including whatsapp, messages etc) has been stopped. i reset my watch is about 3-4 times and the problem is still the same but only one thing which i really like that whenever you workout or do any physical activities, this watch gives you real numbers (including your calories, steps, heart rate, sleep ti..."
30406,5,Bad product Not reading heart rate after 6 months
30407,5,Good product received and worth of money.
30408,1,Totally inaccurate!
30409,4,"Good product, but don't work smoothly with android device"
30410,4,"Nice watch , looks nice but is not a true health tracker. It cannot distinguish between treadmill and walking . Also calorie burn is different from what other machines show"
30411,5,Great watch..durable too
30412,5,Loved it
30413,5,Nice
30414,5,Very nice and so satisfied. Thanks
30415,2,Money waste
30416,1,Look wise it's good...but not accurate. MI band is much more accurate and cheaper comparitively.
30417,5,Nyc
30418,5,Very good product

30420,4,Nice product
30421,5,Perfect

30423,4,good
30424,1,not able to connect with mobile and not even getting notifications and calls on my smart watch.not even worth it really unhappy
30425,3,"The watch looks good but the only issue we are facing is with the App. Very often we need to clear the cache and re-login the app, after every login we have to set the notifications."
30426,5,Berry ghatiya product
30427,3,I was not satisfied with this product.. the item was not fair and call notifications will come and message notifications are not come
30428,4,worth to spend on this product
30429,5,perfect...i got very good deal for 9000...it's been 3 months and no issues so far
30430,5,amazing and well fit to customers requirement. best price it was with all other online website.
30431,1,"watch is not at all user friendly. there is no customer care to contact. Please do not waste your money. from the day one i have purchased, synchronisation issue with phone and once i done factory reset, then watch power off for life time. i can not power on from the date i have done factory reset."
30432,5,amazing product
30433,5,Worth it. To keep tracks of your activities.üòä
30434,5,Nice watch.. Gifted wife on our marriage anniversary and she loved it..
30435,1,dont buy this watch. worst product
30436,5,Supergood.
30437,5,best
30438,2,"Product is good. Asthetics are to my taste. Pedometer isn't accurate. If you're traveling in a bus, it will calculate steps due to sheer vibrations. Battery life is good if you are not using notifications or connected GPS.  Now the worst part - Fitbit doesn't have a single service center any where in the world. So if you damage this watch, you will have to buy a new one. Period."
30439,5,nice
30440,5,Papa is very happy with the watch
30441,5,Full stylish ‚ù§Ô∏è
30442,2,"belt looks decent, but does not fit with the watch pins. You won't be able to use it."
30443,5,Amazing!! You can make your selfie pic as a clock background which feels just so good.
30444,3,it has some of technical issues like notification problem and it take lot of time to load maps.
30445,5,"synchronisation issue, good one to use"
30446,1,battery life is a serious problem.. after on update the battery does not last for even one full day.. been using amazefit.. it's so much better than this one..
30447,5,super
30448,5,"The watch doesn't show the notification of call or message, it always says pair the phone even after pairing the same, raised this issue to Fitbit multiple times, but no response yet."
30449,4,Very nice Fitbit Versa Smartwatch
30450,5,great product
30451,5,I just have praises for this watch
30452,4,base users for a activity trackers
30453,5,loving it.
30454,4,"Overall a good smartwatch. 24x7 heart rate monitor, notifications.. working perfectly with Galaxy M30s. Only negative is step counter is inaccurate."
30455,1,my product is not returned yet. how can the issue be resolved
30456,1,"Connectivity is totally disgusting, notifications never work. Cheaper Chinese watches are better in this regard"
30457,4,good in all aspects.
30458,1,There is a discolouration problem in 1 month. I am highly disappointed by flipkart and fitbit
30459,2,While calculating floors and exercise duration. It's highly inaccurate !!! So accuracy which is the main thing is major issue. Battery backup is good which is 3+ days.  Stopped working in 4 months only. And fitbit take a very very long time to replace your watch.
30460,4,ok
30461,1,"I am using this product from last 2 months, I am using oneplus 6 Mobile. 1) Connectivity Issues ( every time i use to go to settings and reconnect again) 2) Find My Device/Watch not available ( even MI band have this feature) 3) Only to view time and Fitness activities thats it. ( while going in bike also its counting the steps). Instead of this you can buy Mi Band to go with Fitness Activities and time."
30462,4,"Amazing product with one major flaw, it does not play stored songs properly through bluetooth speakers or earphones. The music either plays too fast or too slow. The only difference between versa and versa lite is versas song storage facility which in a way is waste as it does not play properly. save money go for versa lite."
30463,5,very good product...
30464,1,Connectivity issue.
30465,4,excellent watch...only issue is the charger has something inside which sounds something loose..but itz working
30466,2,The battery is not such a log lasting as given.lt give backup up to 80 hours
30467,5,super watch and nice color
30468,5,Awesome. Very Good watch in the category. Light in weight.
30469,4,good one
30470,2,"Not so great!! decent on external, very primitive inside!! light-years to catch-up with what Apple watch offers!! Except for the price, pretty disappointed!!"
30471,4,There is some variance between actual steps and fitbit count...but over all its a superb product
30472,2,very bad.step count incorrect always. waste of money
30473,1,not as expected. 1. Sleep data not correct. 2. Wrist belt is irritating. 3. poor battery. 4. many features are paid and synchronisation after many failed attempt. poor connectivity. .
30474,5,good product fantastic delivery and price by Flipkart thank you Flipkart
30475,5,good one
30476,5,good and accurate
30477,2,It does not have built in GPS and it does not calculate distance accurately. It also does not have walk option in the exercises.
30478,5,very good
30479,1,worst wate of money dont buy display problem with in 20 days it was dead
30480,4,Really good watch worth buying
30481,1,Got it for reasonable price on big billion day..Just after few days of usage the smart watch is getting synced but display is not working..Raised concern to fitbit and replacement order was placed.Did not expect such poor quality from Fitbit.
30482,1,"notification service does not runs on my device, always shows an error message in a red banner in the fitbit app"
30483,5,worth buying....
30484,1,Charger stopped working within 10 days of purchase. Please do some quality checks before handling the product
30485,1,No meeting my expectation as it is not compatible with one plus 5 and it is not mentioned on the app.
30486,3,working as per review but little costly
30487,3,watch is good but app not working properly.. some times i am not able to see notifications in fitbit..
30488,3,Not as expected due to connectivity issues that it has with my one plus phone. Otherwise it is fine but not a value for money buy as spending 8000 for this watch is waste. Could be a steal if available at 4k.
30489,5,nice product....
30490,1,Not worth the price. Step tracking is inaccurate. The band adds car and bike ride as steps. Didn‚Äôt expect this from Fitbit
30491,5,perfect for health reasons
30492,5,super product and delivery on Time üëç
30493,5,go for it guys rocking
30494,1,the Charger is not working and it‚Äôs only been 21 days since I bought it. I don‚Äôt want to recommend it. High risk
30495,4,excellent fitness tracker and a fancy watch
30496,1,In just 5 months this watch stopped working! Requested from Fitbit for replacement and the procedure is so confusing! Not worth the money paid
30497,5,Fantastic watch ..specially for fitness
30498,5,very nice watch received two days before the delivery date and awesome features .
30499,5,awesome product happy to buy this üëç
30500,1,Not good product. Starting for about 10days it was showing correct data. After that it show same results of bpm of all
30501,4,good
30502,2,it's not connected to mobile for calls and messages alerr
30503,1,is it compatible to one plus 5T...i am facing compatible problem.
30504,5,Wonderful Watch with wonderful price..
30505,1,it's not a smart watch which can receive or reply to phone call or WhatsApp message it's a normal fitness band
30506,5,great product
30507,2,"It doesn't feel like a premium watch. Also, the sensors that wake it up are less effective, One has to shake the wrist to wake it up"
30508,4,doesn't support notifications in one plus 6
30509,5,Very nice smart watch. I got in the big billion days . Delivery was on time.
30510,4,very good product with great features
30511,4,good watch.... only lacking call facility
30512,5,Loving this watch thanks to Flipkart for such offer.
30513,2,Counts steps while driving as well as just moving hand back and forth. Expected a lot better product at this price
30514,1,Everytime I'll have to update my watch and it takes like 5 years to update üò†
30515,1,expectation is more while buying but after wearing the smart watch it didn't reach the level very difficult to add a Bluetooth device and adding songs.....
30516,3,Everything is good except I received Chinese variant of the device and the connectivity issue with OP6T
30517,5,"Monitor whole day, involvement and monitoring is design perfectly that make you busy and conscious about losing weight burning calories , listing music as well as controlling breathing & BPM"
30518,2,The product was not as per expectation.
30519,5,genuine product
30520,5,Great product
30521,3,Durablity is good but walking step is not accurate
30522,5,Nice Watch for the Amount
30523,5,awesome.....
30524,3,"Unfortunately I couldn't get any option to get notifications in my Redmi phone..Kindly help..if it doesn't support ,then it will be a waste of money for me!"
30525,5,Excellent product... good to go
30526,5,nice product
30527,2,"i am kind of unhappy wit this , other features are good bt it isn't appropriate atall. sometimes it automatically increases steps while being on rest mode , the fun fact is i remove my watch and sleep amd the other day i see 500 calories burned like i didn't even wear it"
30528,1,Flipkart has provided me a faulty piece or the watch itself is faulty. It is not able to get the notification from my phone. Tried a lot. worst product
30529,1,worst watch
30530,4,stylish and fantastic
30531,4,ok
30532,5,excellent watch
30533,5,best price and good buy
30534,4,the reason why I am giving 4 is it is not syncing with my phone automatically.
30535,5,come with more than expected features.ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞love it.
30536,3,"delivery was so poor, item is nice"
30537,5,Good
30538,2,"Terrible setup experience. Nothing works seamlessly. And Linux is not supported for music uploads, etc."
30539,1,disconnects very frequently with my one plus 6 and then again takes 30minutes to add again ! and doesn't show any notifications! and delivery took 12 days ! worst buy ever !
30540,1,Not connecting for not working properly
30541,5,Nice product
30542,5,very nice
30543,1,Not fully compatible with one plus 6T. Having Notification issue.
30544,3,It's nice but it's Chinese variant
30545,5,Nice watch
30546,1,Very poor quality. Has completely gone dead in one day of usage after factory resetting. Wastage of money.
30547,5,Product is good....look and Activities tracking is nice.
30548,4,beautiful watch
30549,5,Trustworthy companion throughout the clock
30550,4,cool
30551,5,Best smart watch üòçüòçüòç
30552,5,nice product. have been using it for almost a week. got it at a good discounted rate on flipkart.
30553,5,good one
30554,1,"The product doesn't want to start unless the update is done. I spend more than half a day to sort it out, but never successful. In 2019 if few kb data will download forever, then I can't image the build quality. I was very excited for the purchase, but now I regret it"
30555,3,update is taking too much time and adding music to watch also little bit tough. screen resolution is not much. and sometimes connecting with phone also takes much time
30556,1,waste item
30557,5,got it for 7K best in the price range
30558,5,Beautiful and lightweighted watch. Came with extra pair of small and large sized wrist band.
30559,4,"The Watch is good, but the android app is so bad it took nearly 3 hours to update the watch"
30560,5,amazing
30561,1,"Expectations High but sad, not connecting With Bluetooth"
30562,5,"my product has delivered at timely.and i would like to this smartwatch.build quality and design is good,also packing is good.thank u"
30563,5,it's counting steps even while sleeping...its not worth
30564,3,"If like me, you are looking for a GPS watch, it isn't. It is a connected GPS watch which means GPS is connected via your phone. Hence you need to carry your phone will running which destroys it very purpose."
30565,3,"seemes like sent me a used product, the model is of 2017, I was suspicious as the price was pretty low, it works ok for now"
30566,3,"The Bluetooth connectivity goes away in short while. And the notifications does not show up in the watch, except the call. It asks to restart the phone, but even after that nothing changes. you have to install and uninstall the fitbit app every now and then which can never be a permanent solution.  So basically, I am not at all satisfied.  though the heart rate and the steps count is authentic."
30567,5,"Great fitness tracker, just that uploading music is painful. otherwise this is simply amazing"
30568,5,Good
30569,5,very good product n quick delivery by flipkart
30570,3,"Overall good product, step count is way off which should be the primary thing thus watch should do"
30571,1,item is not working. notifications is not working.
30572,1,worst product worst service
30573,5,"Best Smart Watch ever, love it"
30574,5,OK
30575,1,"Inaccurate step, floor count, tracks steps even while driving and sleeping. Not worth it."
30576,3,There must be Indian update also.... like Indian calender.....
30577,2,worst
30578,4,name is enough
30579,5,best fitness watch in the market
30580,1,After one year stopped working and to my suprise there are no service centres of fitbit in india they only have support over the call.
30581,5,Battery backup is very good
30582,5,good one
30583,4,Good One
30584,5,Good
30585,5,product really great . I am totally sctified this product .really good camera for beggner .but flash button was missing that is not good .and capture is 18 mp wasn't good I was hopeed it will be 24 mp . it is also missing .n everything is good .
30586,3,Satisfied with the product.. Its a really good for all who wants to learn photography its a gem and love.... Go for itt....10/10
30587,5,Worth more than the amount. Best DSLR for a good beginner. Friendly camera. Love it. ‚ù§Ô∏è Extremely good with canon 50mm f1.8 STM lens.
30588,4,The camera simply awesome..and it is a best budget DSLR and begginer DSLR for first time user...auto focus mode works good in daylight
30589,5,"product is very good and build quality also , special thanks to Flipkart for fast delivery , best camera for starters , it captures best quality photos"
30590,5,Awsm . I'm not a professional but using of li'l bit xperience must say that best Dslr in a best budget.perfect for a beginners.image quality is too good.thanx to Canon thanx to Flipkart & also thanx to Ecom xpress for perfect delivery.
30591,5,everything is perfect And specially the packaging it was so good .. When it arrived I got surprised because of the carry case I didn't expected that .. thank you so much Flipkart
30592,5,Verry Nice and for My Opinion is great camera For this Price Range. I love it my first DSLR...! üëç Lot of Experiments Is easy with This DSLR .üòé
30593,4,"Camera is good for beginner. But not getting that much high quality pics from this camera or lens. So I order canon 50mm just after my 1st vacation, when I was not satisfied with the quality.. Check you tube regarding the comparison of 18mm and 50mm lens. If you want to buy camera than only kit lens is not just you want from your pics. You have to upgrade with any prime lens,whether it's 50mm or 55-250mm. Thanks"
30594,5,excellent dslr and get a free moto headset worth 6500 I am happy
30595,5,"My first DSLR. good one for beginners. easy to use. worth for money. and as always, super fast delivery by Flipkart. loved it"
30596,5,Camera doesn't matter if you have skill you still click photos like this and lences also define your clicks but if you don't have budget then this camera is for you it is best camera for learning Photography but if you have a little more budget then try to buy at least 1300d or 1500d theses are not great cameras but better then 3000d
30597,4,"good camera n it's my first DSLR I loved it. But delivery took so long. I got camera bag, camera and lense, 16gb card, batter with charger lense cap and carry strap. good camera for beginners."
30598,5,it's clearly evident that's it not a high budget camera. but it's best for everyone looking for a Pocket friendly dslr. specifically for college students and for domestic use.
30599,5,I was planning to buy Dslr for long time. it's really good camera for beginners level photography and of course if any one have ability to shoot good quality photos may take easily with it. Delivery is very fast. Thanks flipkart for providing low cost pocket friendly opportunity on big billion day sale offer.
30600,5,AWESOME DSLR AT THIS PRICE. I HAD A DREAM TO BUY A DSLR .THE MOMENT I BOUGHT THIS DSLR MY DREAM HAS TOTALLY FULLFIL. WAIT LISTENüôè. TO BE HONEST IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT TO START YOUR OWN BLOG OR ANY KIND OF YOUTUBE CONTENT THEN PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BUY DSLR FOR PHOTOSHOT THEN JUST GO FOR IT. AT ANY POINT OF TIME IF YOU THINK THAT YOU NEED MORE QUALITY IN PHOTOS YOU CAN EASILY ADD LENS‚ù§Ô∏è. THANK YOU.
30601,5,Its a wonderful camera for the beginners. Those who have passion in photography and love to shoot its a good choice for them. Trust Canon !
30602,4,Excellent for someone who is new into photography..it gives you flexibility to try out a lots of manual settings just like any expensive dslr..even with kit lens you can click wonderful pictures...Clarity is not that great...For better clarity go for an expensive dslr
30603,5,Good one Best for beginner photographs Not recommend for videography because it is not good for videography or vloging porpes it is heavy and bulky. So if you're priority is photography it's a nice and value for money product.
30604,5,All over great camera nice quality of pictures i took and auto focus mode is work just awesome
30605,5,"Worth Buying ... Superb !! Loved it !! Bulit quality is lil disappointed if we are careful it's ok,overall can fully satisfy in dis price ..."
30606,5,"-Trusted seller with genuine product as shown in the image,from these seller one plus point is you can buy a cheapest dslr online in offer time. -Nice product in this price segment I bought this camera in big billion sale at cheap price,I am sharing some pictures capture with 3000D with 18-55 kit lense. -Its good for biginners. -Easy to use camera. - Switch to any mode it's 'ON' and for switch 'Off' there is a mode on same dial."
30607,4,The product is very good But if I take another lens of 55-250mm lens Then it's amazing so take it for photography And it's best for beginners
30608,5,Well Reviewing this after using for almost one month. I would prefer for the beginner photography. Simple without any complexity. It's best if you learn to use it at Manual mode
30609,4,Best in price segment. If you have skill this entry level dslr can do much better result. Just Dont expect much.
30610,5,Great product. worth of price.. Thanks flipkart for delivering it in 3 days.. I love it... My first DSLR
30611,5,"Just bought it on the offer period for 16800, the product is well worth for the price I believe... this is my first dslr so I think I may be exaggerating , but its a good buy. Visually, the build quality has a premium quality , the quality of the images are good, rich and vibrant, although there is considerable amount of noise in them especially in artificial lighting conditions, buy a prime lens if you want the best quality photos from this one... the buttons are tactile but the screen is be..."
30612,5,"it's a good DSLR to own if u are not a pro and looking for entry level DSLR. This camera comes with 16GB card, and 18-55 lense kit. Then buy separate Fixed Focus Lense for close-ups. This will b a perfect Device then. wifi connection allows u to connect it directly to ur PC or Mobile. Easy to use user interface. strong and sturdy body. battery backup is good."
30613,3,Excellent piece of product for simple usage and can take nice shots of closer locations. Zoom option is not up to the mark and works like any other DC. Faced difficulties capturing a still image of moving objects.
30614,5,"Guys please check the charger and battery when you receive the product. Fortunately my charger is not working fine, I gave it(charger) at canon service center for replacement. if the battery is not working we need pay the money from our pocket and that too we haven't check within ten days...  please use as early as possible one received the product....  One more important thing for any replacement is also take more time..."
30615,5,Best DSLR in this price range and if you are a beginner then you should buy it . And this is canon. Entry level camera in this price range i bought at 20k and know current price is 27k around i am happy to grap under 21k . Its just amazing just buy it you will not regret. Microshot is working perfectly.
30616,5,"Superb product at great price! The class of image which a true blue DSLR can give you is unmatched by even a top end mobile camera. This model is so good, gives the full feel of a heavy duty DSLR while being light on the pocket. The complimentary memory card and camera bag were a welcome bonus, the bag is of good quality. When you hold a Canon camera, you have the assurance and confidence of a top notch product."
30617,4,The product is awesome for a beginner in the photography world it's preety good in this price range I have been using it since 1 week and I personally recommend to go with it by closing your eyes.
30618,5,"Best camera ever. It's my first DSlr, never a disappointed. If you beginner that's have you. Go for it And just click result is awesome. Love you flipkart and love you very much nikon‚ù§Ô∏è"

30621,5,"It's a great deal, images are good, go for it, nice camera for beginners,images videos were amazing, if your budget was less then 30k then go for it don't think to much, I personally liked it. Thanku flipkart for this and for 1 day delivery."
30622,5,"I purchased this last in the month of October after using roughly almost 7-8 months I can say this camera is a gem for beginners and for pro guys you'll not dissatisfied with the quality of camera , image capture quality. good battery backup high quality lense high quality cables even carry case is also good yeah bag looks little old fashioned but who cares about the bag when you have very decent camera at this price range"
30623,5,By my side nice dslr in short range facilities and perfection is very gud. this is not for professional camera bt its img quality like pro.. tnx
30624,5,very good camera.....but not flash not support to this camera... mean that hot shoe is different from common hot shoe.....
30625,5,I thin it was awesome.... I liked very much...... I am a beginner..... I really like my camera EOS 3000D..... NICE Pic clarity...... Lite wait..... Simple functioning..... I like very much.....
30626,3,if you want a good video recording and good full HD pictures so you have to try some other DSLR otherwise it is good for simple use.
30627,4,amazing camera @ such price Range Display pixel is low but clearity in images we seen in mob laptops etc _ Best Camera Recommended for New users Better than my Nikkon D3400
30628,4,"I purchased this as my first DSLR. Still, I am learning. Mostly I am using auto mode only, and use manual mode occasionally. I got very good photos of my car to be posted on CarSangrah. It helped me getting good response."
30629,4,this camer is the perfect one in this because range for photography although it has okay kind video feature but beyon that its perfect for a beginners...it can shoot in raw...which i qs not expecting n evething is so simple to understand in this...im perfectly statisfied with camera .?
30630,5,camera is good but if u are new to use it I would recommend that go for device having LCD screen it will be easy to use. other wise product is good at this price.
30631,5,awsome product and super fast delivery by ekart and the packing of the product was also good...thanks flipkart for ur super fast service
30632,5,A full featured DSLR with a good quality image sensor. It has all the features that are required for a mid level amateur. In skilled hands it is an awesome tool.
30633,5,"Very good camera, the blurr effect works properly here. A good one for new photographers. The camera is having ES mode also."
30634,4,"Guys, I have been using this DSL for almost 2 months, Image quality is very good in good lighting conditions, much better than our mobile phone cameras and indoor performance also good with flash but you can't use it without flash in low lighting condition.  Pros - Decent image quality for this price range. Decent battery life to take 600 photos in single charger. Wi-Fi function with canon app to download photos to smartphone easily.  Cons Fully Auto mode could have been better. On/off ..."
30635,5,its the best DSLR in the price range of below 20k .its a basic model..so don't expect more..but yes its far better than point to zoom cams......doesn't have good zoo.... could have been better...I purchased for 18990/- on big billion day sale...till now I m in learning mode...I m just exploring all the options
30636,5,thanks ekart to deliver 1 day before . thanks to flipkart to shipped at time . And deliver good product no any issue . when open cannon . picture quality is good . this is for new comer on photography . Image quality is good .
30637,5,"Terrific purchase.. I would like say before judging this product on the basis of looks and picture posted by others for this product won't give much exposure. For whom just want to buy a dslr I would say better get some knowledge about DSLR first how to operate it like what is aperture, focal length and shutter speed. Once you have this knowledge you can do anything and everything about photography with this product."
30638,4,Entry level DSLR. If the usage is only for family and trips then its for you. worth the price. capturing photos when screen is on is lagging but works perfect when shot with view finder. Build quality is good
30639,3,product is good nice product in best budget battery backup is not good i didnt like the batery i m going to change the battery it offs suddenly even in a full charge
30640,5,what to say. just the best cam for amature photography enthusiasts. I mostly use it as point and shoot during family functions and spl occasions. works superb. it's pretty fast in taking pics in auto mode and offers all the basic modes as in most cameras but with exceptional picture clarity. just go for it if you are looking for cheap camera and professional quality photos. there is hardly any other camera in the market that offers the same value for money.
30641,5,excellent product and fast delivery by Flipkart. found very good and offer provided was a very good deal for beginners. already 1 month over and all working in good way. original product.
30642,5,"thks for fk for gud deal offer. thks to seller for timely despatch and safe packing. it's a gud deal for this money, gud for beginners. I gifted it for my dad."
30643,4,Camera is very good to take pictures and easy to handle. I am facing only problem of focus. If rotate the zoom to take close photo then it is not clear. May be i am not aware to set properly zoom. Otherwise in open area this is very good. Even can take photos of hills and from long distance.
30644,5,Nice decent camera. worth every penny. got it for 19k during but billon day. lightweight. WiFi enabled: camera connect app Iain Google pay should be installed to use also can use mobile as remote for taking pictures when connected through WiFi.
30645,4,Since this is my first DSLR so I give it 4 stars (after using it for a day) as I don't have anything to compare it with. But this has got all the features that a begginer can think of. Though an Auto Flash and a Metal Lens Mount (metal being more durable) could have added the fifth star to my rating. Picture quality is good considering 18 MP camera you can't expect more. Upgrade the lens if you want to have a better experience. I am not much worried about the video quality as I bought this fo...
30646,5,"Amazing camera for beginners. It really allows you to learn basics of photography like shutter speed, iso, aperture etc. I recommend every beginner to first learn how to use this one thoroughly and then move on to professional level cameras like 80D or 5D."

And one more thing I wanted to say, there are somany reviews and videos on youtube sayibg this 3000D build quality is plastic.. But belive me you don't feel this is plastic.

30742,4,"I didnt know much about these DSLR s before owning this, I would suggest to buy a touch screen model by spending a little more. And always buy with bundled lens offer else it would cost a lot more to buy the 55/250 lens separately. The 18/55 lens which comes along is pretty basic."

30896,5,I bought this camera in the year 2018 for 16K giving this review after more than 2yreas of using. Its a complete satisfaction I must say. With its wifi and remote photography options what more can you expect at this price. It a perfect choice for some who wants to learn.
30897,5,"Got it for 20k flat ! Excellent product for beginners and learners ! It even comes with a free learning courseware subscription the box ! Only thing tou need to take care is that the Mount ring lacks steel reinforcement, so lens changes need to be carefully done...."
30898,5,"For 19k its worth only, country of origin: Thailand"
30899,1,Absolutely damaged product... There was white fungus under the display... Disgusting.. Neber expected that Flipkart Assured products will be of such pathetic quality!!! I was totally shocked to see the fungus..which was also not removable!!! Shame!!!

30924,5,nice DSLR
30925,4,good products
30926,5,Superb camera.
30927,1,There is a problem in auto zoom. It takes a lot of time in stabilizing the focus. I tried a lot to return and sorder a higher version ..but Flipkart policy has changed and this is creating a problem for us.  I request Flipkart to consider return also...not just replacement.. because we put a lot of money in products and if that comes out to be bad...then we are stuck. I'll make sure not to order anything . Would prefer buying it after testing in the market .. paying a bit more .. Atleast 500...
30928,5,Best Camera for beginners this is the best low-cost DSLR
30929,4,good camera
30930,5,best for beginers ill just say its osm
30931,5,super... my first DSLR.... it's my birthday gift from my wife....
30932,1,waste of money
30933,5,i just love this cammera delivery is so fast .cammera is amazing
30934,5,excellent product ....
30935,5,"It's is most wonderful camera but single that one this bad 18_55 lens only camera bulr on back ground super low zooming one of this bad but money value able camera... Good, super, osm, vera 11,"
30936,4,excellent packing and product.
30937,5,"Good camera for personal use,"
30938,5,Very bad return policies. I will not buy in future anything... Baster policies
30939,5,it is wow camera it is better than Nikon d3400 heavy performance

30942,4,Quality is good in this price range...
30943,4,"Just go fr it guyz, itz awsm camera ‚ù§Ô∏è"
30944,4,good
30945,5,Nice camera.with perfact priceüëåüëåüëå
30946,5,It's awesome clarity
30947,5,best camera available i just got it for rs 18999.0
30948,5,good
30949,3,Pixel quality bad when image zooming
30950,5,Good for the price but I would suggest if you have money then go for 1500d. Can capture decent picture but the display size and color production is very poor if you compare it with 1300d or 1500d.  I have attached some sample shots. For more sample shots you can visit (Abhinav____ on instagram)
30951,5,Good
30952,5,Very good photo
30953,1,Wast of mony
30954,5,"Product is very good. Got in okay condition, but Flipkart has not packed it safely as it's a sophisticated product which needs to be packed for safety during shipping. And secondly I want to mention this time Flipkart fooled me by not giving the camera bag with the pack. Memory card is also excluded from the pack. Atleast bag should be there."
30955,5,Very good camera but hotshoe system is not satisfied
30956,4,Excellent product
30957,5,Good product I love it
30958,3,"At least it should have the basic accessories like beg, datacable to connect to or laptop and a memory card.... top of the camera need to expend more then 5k to buy basic accessories."
30959,4,Best option as an entry level DSLR. And with 18-55 lens still manages to get background blurred pictures.
30960,4,"Two reasons for not rating 5 stars. One, I would have paid a bit more for a memory card too. Please include it, it's not complete without one. Two is more a camera display issue- it tends to randomly become quite white. I just passed my return by date, so I can't return, but it's a random issue. I've seen that reinserting the battery solves it."

31694,2,"Using it for quite some time. Fellow buyers, please don't get too much impressed with all these positive reviews. Even if price drops to 20000 during sale, its not worth it. Image quality is just like a smartphone. LCD screen has very very few pixels, so you can't use it in live view mode and also can't actually analyse picture you have just clicked. Autofocus is generally slow in live view mode in most of dslr but in this camera, it is very very slow. Image has too much noise in indoor shot..."

31756,3,The build quality is ok .....plastic but looks good . For a entry level camera its best in this price range . But you want a serious photography career then nikon is best .....the natural colour is better in nikon. It has one issue sometimes you can't able to take picture with flash mode on in Auto mode.....still I m struggling to solve this .....its a bad experience with this dslr. But picture quality is good for a entry level dslr.
31757,5,Value for money! I loved it ???

31767,4,"It's a great entry level dslr. If you are new into the photography or video making then you may go for this product. But i would suggest you to buy Canon 1500D, if you can. After you will be used to this product then you will feel like you have to upgrade but you may not be able to buy the new one. So, go for Canon 1500D if you are buying this, if you can't afford that, then you may go for this one. At last you are the user, you must know what to buy, Do some research on what you really need."

32411,5,Product was awesome
32412,5,"Canon says ""Delighting you always"". Well, am delighted! First impression, I love the camera and the accessories provided. Choosing 50mm prime lens was the best option. I don't feel to remove the lens out of my camera because the lens is that good. Buy additional memory card and a battery (LP-E10) for professional use. Simple and easy to navigate. Good beginner's camera ‚ò∫Ô∏è you can get best photos with it. Highly recommended!"

32519,5,"I'm not good photographer, so with my limited knowledge and usage, I'd say camera is more than value for money. Yes, pics quality is good, in both day & night (using flash). A lens and a camera kit bag which comes as supplement is an added benefit to carry & handle the camera safer during outing. Needless to say flipkart's service as it was delivered as promised!!!! Overall, considering it's price,this camera basic DSLR model, will be useful for the beginners."

33700,4,mind blowing product for beginners..got it at 18500/
33701,4,First of all this porduct is really good if your're new to photography and you dont need a high end camera unless you wanna make your career into it. Better spend on lenses. This camera is very good. But this review is considering the price in which I get. I got it for around 16.5k and that's hell of a deal. But usb cable for camera was missing from the package. Though the package was seal packed. If you get it for similar price range go ahead and buy.

For beginners extra lens not necessary. 1500D is 24MP and 3000D is 18MP and price difference is 10,000Rs, you can't see big difference between 24MP and 18MP so go fot 3000D."

Light weight, well equipped with functionalities, and moreover the focus is pretty impressive. Only con I feel is the absence of auto flash, but that can be ignored as the pricing is pretty aggressive and it gives better performance than it's counterpart frok nikon. And thanks to Flipkart, the delivery was before time and spot on."

33991,5,"You can't have a better mid-range DSLR. However I don't like 18mm-55mm lens, but you'll get sharp and crisp photos with 70mm-300mm lens. The camera is feature loaded and very light. You'll love it."
33992,5,If you confused between nikon d5600 and canon 200d then go with nikon d5600 without thinking again. It is very good camera with excellent features. The camera features 39 autofocus point helps us to focus faster and produces clear image. I share some images of the camera sample hope you like it.
33993,5,"Best Mid range camera for photography lovers. I am writing the review after 3 months of using this cam , this is my 1st DSLR canon is a user friendly cam, it is basically good for videography. Nikon is quite hard to use,. it is best for photos if you want to upgrade your photography Tallents , and you are looking for a mid range cam ,. 100% go for it., lenses are good, 70-300 mm lens is mind-blowing output. so, go for dual lenses"
33994,5,"Excellent camera for beginner photographers and also a best back up for pro also. Amazing colour depth, fast focusing, crystal clear photo. Lightweight is a advantage while you are travelling. Vary angle screen is very useful when taking ground level shots or over the crowd shots and very helpful for blogging purpuse also. You can attach external mic. Battery life is very good. Through WiFi and snapbridge downloading photos in smartphone from camera is too easy. It supports Bluetooth also. I..."
33995,5,"I think this the best entry level dslr in this range. I got a 18-55mm kit lense, 16gb memory card and lowepro bag. Bag quality is good. This model is good because you are getting a touch screen enabled dslr in the price range where most of other brands giving non touch screen models. Some features like very easy to operate, touch screen, fast auto focus and sharp images make this dslr a best entry level dslr. I am attaching some pictures clicked with this dslr(flipkart not letting me add more..."
33996,5,"Awesome product. If you are looking for semi-pro DSLR you can buy this without it thinking. Easy handling, easy handy features"
33997,5,"Wow, love the Camera....I have already used Nikon d 3500 in my Laboratory but this camera is far better. Flipkart delivered at time and the product was at best conditions. This is my first personal DSLR, so guys after using for 2 weeks, I must say that go for it, there is no other camera which could provide same level as Nikon d 5600. Colour tone production, lots of effect, smooth touch screen, good battery life, etc. Just go for it."
33998,5,No doubt Nikon's lineup for intermediate DSLR are catchworthy . but one must also invest in additional lenses to get the most out of d5600 . like in my case I ordered 35mm 1.8g lens when paired with d5600 produced great results . not going over the specifications. camera is just awesome produces detailed and sharp images .  70-300 lens do have its own advantages .but after 250mm its just doesn't perform up to the mark.but hey! you get this in that price bracket which is fine to me .  guid...
33999,5,"My First DSLR and the best decision that I made. The KIT lenses are not so ideal for lowlight photography but you can always get the best out of it. Overall very satisfied with the quality of photos, camera body and lens to start the learning process."

34002,4,Good semi professional dslr from Nikon. Packing is good and the product is really nice. Not recommended for professional photographers and good for a beginner. It's features are best in class and have a good quality material in real. It's touch function is lit. Rotating screen helps in taking photos or record videos in selfie mode or in certain positions. The bag which is packed with the camera will only have the space to adjust lesser items. For a professional photographer it is recommended ...

34005,5,Best DSLR for beginners..don't think too much just click buy now..!I purchased on bbday with a great deal but i bought single lens. So i suggest please if you want more depth or wildlife photography then go for 70-300 mm also. Even though it can deliver good photos with this 18-55 mm lens. Thanks to Flipkart for the great package and delivery. Happy click..!
34006,4,Reviewing after using for an year. This is my first dslr and It gives stunning images. The 70-300 lens is simply awesome and thats the one I use the most. Autofocus while taking video is really bad. It cant focus well on moving objects. Even for slowly moving subjects it doesn't focus well. I think Canon200d is good if you prefer videography as it has much faster autofocus although the price is much higher than Nikon D5600 .But if your preference is only photography then go for it as it is a...
34007,5,"Cant say anything about the DSLR right now cause I am learning how to shoot but flipkart delivered it in a safe packaging and on time..  Edited on 16 Jan 2020 So, now I am using this for last 6 months and I want to say best in this price. I am not highlighting the features which all dslr have. but the best features which you will get in this price which none other dslr can give you today are 1. Articulated Touch screen. 2. Wifi transfer. 3. 39 AF point  Just go for it. Its a big plus. check o..."
34008,4,The camera is excellent. Probably the best one in this price range. Completely happy with the camera.  Would like to mention that the bag I received is a good quality Nikon original bag.  Giving 4 stars because it took 14 days to get the product delivered despite of having a Flipkart plus membership.
34009,5,"This is one step above the Entry level ( Nikon D3*** series). Pro - Light weight , Easy to handle , wifi , articulated screen . Image Quality is good . Low light performance is good . Better than expected. Snapbridge for your easy file tranfer Can shoot Raw + Jpeg Best in Mid level DSLR I had got a ridiculous deal with 18-55 and 70-300 deal. Thanks to Flipkart.  Cons - insufficient grip . Those who are new to DSLR won't find this . But the ones who are trying to upgrade this will disappoi..."
34010,5,"It was delivered in good condition. When it comes to camera, it is really good and easy to use. Good choice for a beginner."
34011,4,Awesome product but came with worst packaging. The seal of the packaging box was open. Flipkart should show some effort in packing camera like they do in mobiles. About the camera I would say that it's one of the best dslr in its class. But flipkart providing only 8gb card instead of 16gb. Rest the product is all good. Happy imaging.
34012,5,iam surprised. great dslr at this price range.. better to handle.. user friendly cam.. low light picsüí• .. really loved it !!
34013,5,"Great APSC DX camera which stand besides the Big brother D7100 & D7200. Instead of thease it have a Articulated Screen with Touch function, its a great option for those looking Midranged entry leval DSLR. U can also check D5500 & D5300. overall its a great deal. If u dont mind about your pocket then u can choose D7100 or D7200."
34014,5,pros : Beginner level camera bast for YouTube purpose focusing is fast in photo only build quality is amazing effects extra feature is best for quick retouching zooming and Focusing very perfect inbuilt mic plus sound battery backup amazing  cons : Difficult to learn User interface Bag quality is worst low performance in videography only 16Gb memory card provided  overall best
34015,5,It's amazing . I liked it. I order it in 15.2.20 and it came in 18.2.20 fast delivery. And the photos are also good.
34016,5,Great camera for all beginners. I have been using it for an year. Great specs with this price. If you just a photography enthusiast then u should go for it.
34017,5,Great quality ... It's not a beginner camera ... It's a middle professional camera ... Good image quality ... I loved it
34018,4,every thing works fine except for auto focus excellent for photos terrible for videos one thing this camera can improve on is autofocus love the manual flash option for in built flash
34019,4,awesome product for great value 36k I got this product at 36k which was awesome.and its genuine product criss checked with nikon site.go for it guys
34020,5,"The best DSLR for beginners, if your budget is around 50k then you should definitely go for it awesome camera in great price range. Here are some unedited clicks."
34021,5,Worth for money. Packing was good and everything claimed by Flipkart was there in the box. Nikon D5600 is really a DSLR camera with a lot of functions and an excellent quality of pics.
34022,4,"Camera is pretty darn good as mentioned by other people. Bag was just pure awfulness, wore out in a few days."
34023,5,it is a good camera in a reasonable price.it is easy to handle and has descend battery back up.it was delivered safely.
34024,5,"Great camera for beginners and go for it if you are one. If you have a heavy pocket, my suggestion is to go for a full-frame(sensor) camera instead of this. This one is great, but eventually you'll need to upgrade to full-frame as you evolve and no longer be a beginner in photography.  Overall it's a good package with a wide range of lens compatibility, not only from Nikon but from other manufacturers as well."
34025,5,I am writing the review after one week of usage...  The product is just awesome! Performs very well in both indoor and outdoor photography. Low light performance is also upto the mark. Love this product. Unbeatable in this price range. 70-300 mm lens is adding more flavour to it‚ô•Ô∏è. Video recording is a bit concern. But never regret after buying it
34026,5,one of the best DSLR for beginners.. I upgraded from D3200 to D5600.. I'm loving it üòä
34027,5,Writing review after usage. very good camera and clarity also good. 70 to 300 lens is very good. Best camera at this price for beginners. I am also beginner and added my photos
34028,5,Excellent buy. Camera with 18-140mm lens is quite compact for DSLR standards. Nikon interface is easy to use for the first time Nikon buyers. Touch has right sensitivity and response . that really helps to focus the object with a touch of the finger rather than fiddling around with buttons. Images are quite sharp even on 140mm range.  Flipkart delivery was a let down. delivery executive just handed over the package to security gate without informing me. And the package was crushed outside. L...
34029,5,Awesome purchase. Auto focussing and different effects are really positive of this product. Very impressive and easy to carry and handling.
34030,5,"After too much of research i decided to buy d5600 with 18-140mm lens. Any beginner planning to buy DSLR, this is the right choice. It's my first DSLR & I'm really happy with the service & product. Thank you flipkart for delivering it the very next day. Awesome packaging & lower pro bag is pretty good."
34031,5,"This is going to be quite funny.  I owned a Nikon D5200 and it pretty much served me well. I bought it for 16k from overkart (refurb) and it didn't have any complaints at all. Recently, I've been more into photography and thought of upgrading my d5200.  I didn't need a pro SLR as I ain't a full time photographer. But wanted a compact yet capable camera. I filtered out the suitable options and finally made into two ; Nikon D5600 and Canon 77d.  Now here begins the fun part. How to choose o..."
34032,4,"First of all, excellent delivery and packing by flipkart. amazing camera. very compact and small in size. easy to handle. stand kit lens 18-55 is good and af speed is super fast and super quiet.  only drawback - snapbridge is really bad !!"
34033,5,I've been using it since couple of days and it just impressed me. I am a beginner in photography yet this camera helped me capture some stunning shots.
34034,5,I have uploaded unboxing video on my YouTube channel ''Kushagra Porwal '' and firstly I have decided to buy Nikon D5300 instead of D5600 but only screen difference is there in both the cameras that D5300 has not a touch screen and D5600 has a touch screen and Nikon D5600 has a great video quality and has more functions Very good camera just go for it without any confusion and photo and video quality is also awesome. The camera has a flip screen which helps you to take selfies and is also goo...
34035,5,My first DSLR. Nice and genuine camera sent by Flipkart. But was delivered after many followups and two weeks after the order. Got it for 34K (with one lens) on big billion day sale. Nice deal I guess.!! About picture quality and camera quality I will write soon.
34036,5,"5 on 5 stars Excellent camera with awesome and crisp quality Easy to use for beginners with simple settings.. love this camera and the lens 18-140mm Bought it for 53,000/-"
34037,5,so overall experience was good but flipkart has to work on their problems regarding packaging. As a assured customer of a flipkart we believe in you while purchasing costly products so you should do packing well not only for your satisfaction but for customer satisfaction. when we saw product packing we felt a sheer disappointment..but we are giving 3/5 for early delivery of product only. so pleased work on it..
34038,5,"Excellent entry level dslr for someone who wants to upgrade from mobile photography. 2016 model but Nikon has not released any other camera in this range. Well packed. Received in good condition. 18-55 mm and 70-300 mm kit lenses are okay for beginners. However, to get pro like pics, one needs to learn some editing (all pro photographers shoots in RAW format and edit their pics) . The provided Nikon bag is okay to start with along with the two kit lenses. Image quality is superb. You can buy ..."
34039,5,Nic camera. And Good and great quality of images and. Auto focus is excellent. Pixel density is Assom and mind blowing. Best dslr for mid level and professional photographer
34040,5,Bought the camera as my first SLR camera being a enthusiatic amature photographer. The main reason to go for this over the D3500 is the rotating touch display which helps more than you think. The photography related aspects of the camera is identical to the D3500 but the features are more and AF points are also a bit more. In the world of fast growing mirrorless cameras the D5600 is truly still a great option for any entry level photographer. Most pohotographer do not need a full frame camera...
34041,5,"Awesome choice for beginners. It is my first DSLR and I like it so much. Flipkart delivered it within the promised time. Wanted to tell about the bag, I received NIKON original bag."

34043,5,Just loving it every time I use it. It's handy and very convenient to handle.Images are mind blowing but you really need to use it manually for better results than auto mode. Flipkart took hardly a day to deliver it and the packing was good. Go for it without a second thought!

Got at a very good deal , seller also shipped it on time but the courier ecom express delivered late , the outside box (carton ) was also damaged.

34048,5,Really a joy to use. Very good camera to start with. It is my first DSLR and I am really very happy with the images and the focus. Good for photography to begin with. Not so good for video as it hunts for focus when we move from a subject which is annoying. I don't do much video so I really love this camera?
34049,5,One of the best product in this price range. Picture quality is awesome. 0ackaging was good too and the delivery was at my doorstep. Thank you.
34050,5,"The product works exactly as promised. It is a very convenient dslr with built in intervalometer and a flip out display which makes the photo making process hassle free and more such features are worth paying a little extra than getting a D3500 or related segment camera.  Only DRAWBACK is that the battery life is low and the battery charger doesn't carry a warranty. My charger took its last breath right after one month of purchase, so I had to go for a 3rd party charger.  But overall I'd s..."

34056,5,"Well my review is supposed to be rated 4.5 rather than a 5, if I wrote this review without using the camera first. This camera is a great piece for people who are on a advanced beginner to a mid experience level. It offers all the functionalities that you would demand from a good DSLR and then it adds some tweaks here and there to spice up the experience for you.  What I was angry about was that the camera came with the AF-P lenses than AF-S lenses. Something I absolutely didn't see while ord..."

We advise you to check the warranty entitlements of the products sold through e-commerce websites/ portals under the brand name ‚ÄòNikon‚Äô. But this was posted in their site on 09-09-2015.

34303,2,camera bag is not original
34304,3,"Everything in the camera is good, but if you buy this from store, a Samsung bluetooth headset worth Rs 3000 is complementary with any DSLR camera, but if you buy from here seller doesn't send the bluetooth headset. This is the cheating as nikon himself is giving complementary headset, then what is the problem with seller for sending the same. Camera is fantastic and both the lenses are working superb. Thanks"
34305,5,NICEEEE CAMERA
34306,5,"In the Entry level DSLR category, this is the best option. D5600 is compared to 200D, but in real word 5600 fairs much better in all areas. Go for it!!"

34308,3,camera is fine but the free Samsung Bluetooth headphone was not provided
34309,5,"Everything is ok, but I got a camera backpack instead I wanted a sling bag to carry my camera. Now this sometimes make me uneasy to carry both laptop and camera together. So if you are looking for a backpack with the camera then no doubt, go for it but if you want a sling bag then, i think you should confirm it first from their services. Happy Clicking!"

34515,4,Its been two days since I started using the camera. First thing to say is that I didn't get bag along with the product. They could have provided a bag as its a costly dslr. Some people said they got a headphone along with the product. I don't have any complaint about not getting the headphone. But carry bag is an essential accessory. 4 star only for this reason. Otherwise no complaints. It's a good product as we know.

Canon is for videography since it has Dual pixel auto focus which gives us cinematic focus..  If your main Concept is for Photography only.. Just Go for it.. No doubts it was amazing! N..."

34682,5,"Product is good, there was a glitch on the last stage of delivery. Got my delivery cancelled for the day twice after getting a text 'Out for delivery', just because two delivery executives had developed some confusion between them about the responsibility of delivery of my shipment. At last, I had to travel 50km up down to pick it up myself from a flipkart facility. Hoping for more professionalism for my next delivery that is scheduled for tomorrow."
34683,5,Awesome product
34684,5,Excellent product
34685,4,In comparison to canon 200dii....nikon d5600 is the best in photography than 200dii. but in video department 200dii is the best. If your main priority is photography go for d5600 which have better auto focus points and colour depth

The image quality of this camera is really awesome & amd the kit lens works really well. Low light photography is preety good. If you're a beginner like me, this camera's functions would be slightly complicated but after a little bit experience, you'll be able to capture great quality pictures even without external equipments.

35083,5,"Awesome camera. Even the low light photos are great with the kit lens. I am wondering what wonder this will do with prime lens. And one very important thing, The lenses for Nikon are way costlier than the Canon's. e.g. 50mm stm lens for canon is priced at around 7500 INR but 50 mm nikkor 1.8 g lens is 12500 INR, so choose the camera wisely. And if that does not bother you, you can buy this for sure. You will never regret the decision."

35688,5,Super camera and lightweight camera and lens and smooth using lens
35689,5,"Very nice printer, is worth the purchase. Ideal for Home printing but the black cartridge prints hardly 100 Pages and same with Color cartridge.The cartridge price is costly so I suggest you to Buy GoColor Canon compatible ink's each bottle is of 100 ML and you will find that there's is difference between Original and GoColor ink's. You can refill the cartridge at home in the kit you get everything just watch a video on YouTube and you will save you 96% Printing cost. I have done the same thi..."
35690,5,"great !! easy to use ,, budget friendly,, good printing quality,, looks comfortable, weight also user friendly"
35691,5,nice product I am a student I ordered this for my work I don't have a computer or a laptop I only have Android phones so I ordered that and now I print the worksheet from this printer very nice printer
35692,5,super Good delivery and canon printer is Good Quality.... value of money.. best product..
35693,1,After using 1 year I am writing  Product seems to good but it make you to spend more money to purchase New cartridges  Believe me never think to purchase it  It's very less efficient for avg class people Cartridges cost you approximately 15-18 hundreds of rupees  Print quality is not good as laser printer  After refilling not expect to see good results  It's very very very bad product it's not allowed you to scan after ink of cartridges goes less  So my suggestion to all those people who want...
35694,5,"Was delivered within 48 hours. Not bad I must say since I ordered it during the current festive season.  What I got with this very neat looking printer -  1. connecting cables 2. color + black ink cartridges 3. Driver cd  Unlike in the reviews mentioned earlier, the printing speed is quite good, scanning is excellent and it just looks so neat sitting in my office back home.  Ideal for home use. Good product. And the price was a steal.  Cheers to Flipkart :)"
35695,5,"I loved this oder . The delivery boy's behaviour was also good . Very good product, worth of money and i loved a feature that we can zerox,print and scan. In the last i want to say that very very very very good product.üëçüèªüëçüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªü•∞üòçüòò"
35696,4,"Looks great but it was very delicate piece nd also careful with plugin points as they are sensitive, overall it is best for home printers. Doesn't have bluetooth or wifi connection only works through cable. Printed nicely and easy to print."
35697,4,For the price of 1999 its a good deal. The printing is very slow. The copy and scan function works fine (good speed). Ink cartridge as usual are costly and one time purchase will sum up-to the printers cost.   The black ink cartridge won't even last 40 papers. Its showing low ink now. I am pretty sure color cartridge will be the same.
35698,5,"Timely delivery. Print quality is excellent. Easy to install. Got it at the best price. As usual, happy with my shopping experience"
35699,1,printer is very good but it's cartage is not good because it prints less than 100 copies and even after cartage is empty than new cartage cost is very high.. So I don't recommend this printer to anyone.
35700,5,"its a good printer, but i found it little slow to start printing. the scanner is really awesome which give good clarity"
35701,5,Very nice product . I am loving it . best printer at this price
35702,5,Amazing printer But cartridge is expansive But there is a way you can save your money by refilling your cartridge Just purchase ANG refill ink and fill cartridge You can see videos in youtube of cartridge refill By this way you can save your money upto 95 % Once again product is amazing Thanks flipkart for fast and safe delivery ‚ù§
35703,5,Best thing is abt the cartridges are very easily available and they can be refilled as well unlike most of the other printer.  Scanning Quality and speed is great as compared to others.
35704,5,"PROS: 1. Available at cheap price. 2. Decent for less amount of printing. 3. Scanner is fast and colour accurate.  CONS: 1. Ink capacity is too low, hardly prints 40 pages with the cartridge included. 2. Print speed is too slow. 3. Cartridge are costly as compared to other printer.  Suggestion: Get a cartridge refill kit which has all essential tools required and good quality ink! Happy Printing :)"
35705,3,The product you sent me had faulty scanner.the service centre was nearby so.i got it fixed .. this not a good thing. But i am a kind person so i will buy another one and give this seller another chance ..  Btw its a good printer like hp1050
35706,5,it is good and viry high compartiable product it can scan fast and it can print with a good print its good printer so many of them should by withs seller
35707,4,So far it's good . I got a little blinding edges but it's just minor details . The colour print quality is pretty amazing it's like the ones we get cafes . Yes buying the ink will be expensive . Printed some cartoons and I'm happy they look amazing.
35708,2,Pros: 1. Decent Product for home use (only for printing and copying). Printing speed is average. Easy to troubleshoot  Cons: 1. Configuring scanner is a big head-ache. The driver given along with the product wont be compatible or have some issues with Win7(I tried with 2 laptops and a desktop). Communicated with Canon support to sort it out. But again stopped working in a months time 2. Makes lot of noise while printing.  Verdict: You can use this product only for printing and copying. I...

35710,2,This printer is good also it can be used to copy but this is not good for scanning. scanning option is seen anywhere. printing and coping is clear and good. good for homely use.
35711,4,"Received the printer in good condition. It looks modern, and the shape and size is pleasing to the eye. It installed fairly easily. Found it convenient to use. Printout is of sufficiently good quality. Overall, a good product. The price of the printer is low, so I don't think that the printing costs are going to be very good."
35712,5,"Well agree to some of the reviews made that it is slow, however note that it happens only while using it for the first time.  After the color test page is printed, you will see that the printing speed is comparatively better.  Ink Cartridge are a bit expensive and even one of the ink gets finished you wont be able to use Printer, the best alternative would be ink colors that are available in flipkart.  Delivery was as usual best by Flipkart."
35713,4,Best printer with reliable price. Easy setup and installation. Works excellent with Linux OS as no need to supply CD and driver. Everything is done by linux itself.
35714,5,Before time delivery and well packed. Very good printer for domestic use.. Good quality printing and scanning. Recommended product from my side in the price range.
35715,4,"I am writing this review after 4 years of use. The printer worked fine for whole 4 years. Easy to scan and xerox. Print quality is good. Cartidge is costly. After using for 4.5 years, it is showing some software error. Canon Service Centre is asking for 2500/- (same as the printer price) to reset the processor IC of the printer. Hence I placed an order for a new one again from Flipkart."
35716,1,"It's been a week since I bought the product and still haven't been successful in getting it connected to an android phone. Downloaded two apps and still not done. Such products should have longer duration for returns and should also have refund options. I still haven't managed. If there is anyone to support or guide, pls contact."
35717,4,good product at low price. good for home use specially for school project. delivery was done by GATI. could be more efficient. Flipkart just love you for your offers .
35718,3,Hey..! I've been using this canon pixma as my first printer for about 6 months..!  Pros : It is really cost efficient..my usual cartridge refill last about 2 months of basic home usage+projects 2. It is scanner + printer which both works fine. 3. Doesn't take much space and sheets Cons : Sometimes dont give efficient results.some smudges and print on paper Paper takes too much time to get recieved in printer Overall its a good product but only recomment it for home use.üéÄüéÄ
35719,5,Very nice product in affordable price.delivery was good.packing was awesome .printer working very much fine .
35720,5,Superb very friendly for personal use very fast and good quality love it
35721,5,"Excellent product in seal pack . Lowest price for an all in one . Good quality printing , scanning . Easy to handle for personal use"
35722,5,The most important thing is it has a refill friendly cartridge which according to me is a very important feature in the current market...the print quality is good...the scan quality is awesome..flipkart gave it to me within 16 hours..by which i was totally surprised...a must buy cuz its too good a machine for this price...
35723,1,"Well despite the fact that its a good brand. The product is not worth buying. I bought it some 8 month back and believe me it has hardly given some good response and hardly got 30 copy printed. Such a Waste of money, instead get it xerox from store and get a good one."
35724,5,"Great product for an average user, it's perfect for office or school work and the best thing it's color cartridges ain't much costly either."
35725,4,very good product and nice printing.. I am really very happy ....but ink cartridge ends very quickly and not used to others purpose.

35727,2,"You'd better not to buy this. Yes, printer cost is comparatively low and print quality is also excellent. But what about the printing cost? Highly expensive. Ink cartridges (XL) cost is more than that of the printer itself. No other similar cartridges available in the market so that you have an option which one to buy. Better not to buy it, event if it is a cheap and good quality. We have to keep in mind- A printer is not a show-piece; it has to print day to day."
35728,2,"Product quality is good. But the Ink cartridge is small with the printer in two numbers (ie. Colour & black) Refill cartridge cost above Rs.800/-. Flipkart delivery boy insisted the ""home"" delivery in our area, we given the delivery address clearly at the time of booking with Pincode. After few argument, finally they delivered ""on the road"" nearer to the address given. I am not happy with the delivery, that is why 2 star rating given."
35729,5,printing is really superb ... Canon is the best product.... and finally Flipkart always given a genuine product ...and in time delivery.. tq so much such a wonderful opportunity for us...

35738,4,"Till now it work very fine ,cartrege ink consume very fast ,otherwise it is good product at this price ,"
35739,5,Printer is very good but ink finished off soon both black and colour The print pages doesn't exceed more than 50 also better to go for laser print
35740,5,Very good looking product and so clean printing of this printer I love it because the quality of this print is so nice......
35741,5,Well product and proper work well printing and smoth printin
35742,4,It is good and works smoothly . Overall very good product.
35743,4,Good quality and best price.. Very trendy and handy to use at work place..
35744,5,"its a good printer, but i found it little slow to start printing. the scanner is really awesome which give good clarity"
35745,3,printer is good but only give 100-150 black and White And 50-70 colour page in Starter Cartidge. And thr Photo Printing is Not Good... I recommend you to go for better printer. u can only use it if you are student.
35746,3,it's compact for colour .it's too use 650 copies colours.and throw it. just use like use and throw product . simplyfy if one colour copy is 5 rupees the how much for 650 copies it's very useful
35747,2,Best t Best Buy on Flipkart nice to print absolutely fine
35748,5,"It is doing fairly good job in printing, scanning and copying. It comes very handy at home for children projects and small printing and photocopying tasks. One important thing to note: - in specifications, flipkart has given NO duplex print option. But it has MANUAL DUPLEX PRINTING OPTION. Printer interface is guiding how to change paper for printing on second side of the paper. I took printout on both sides of paper through MS word and PDF files. I am much satisfied with its performance."
35749,5,A very great printing is done by this awesome printer. Budget friendly as well as excellent performance is what I review.Must buy from Flipkart cuz of amazing price and fast delivery.
35750,4,Very good deal at 2k. Black cartridge cost 500 and colour 700. Do all work nicely. Do not support through otg or android mobile. No app supports its driver. Mg2500 driver on android apps does the work but thos apps are charging rs500.
35751,5,"In this budget, it gives great service. I have bought it specially for scanning purpose. It gives good scanned images as well as scanned pdf documents. Its printing quality is also good."
35752,4,purchased this product a few days back. Recieved on time and it is working perfectly and value for money. the best all in one printer at affordable price. As i know it is the only printer with multi-functions and at such low cost in the market right now. So guys go for it.
35753,5,such a nice machine it's not like ricket science easy to install works well compact design BUT it takes 2-3 seconds to dry the ink
35754,5,super nice and super cool
35755,4,This product is good and very nice. at normal price and getting good quality product anyone can buy this product black and white colour print nice
35756,5,Nice work printer is good Light wait with nice print
35757,3,This printer works only 2 months after refined ink not work in perfectly
35758,5,I'm a student and this printer is so helping me in project works and my many other works of schools. I like it .
35759,4,"good product, nice image printing, good zeros quality, I am Happy this product."
35760,4,"Not bad for price you pay, i was mainly looking for scanner and it does work so no complain. I struggled to do setup though, it took 1 day to figure out that it only works when you insert both cartridge, as my plan was to scan i didn't put color cartridge and that caused error 214021. Wish there could have been some better info on this... Printer is also good but ink drys too fast so don't expect much out of it."
35761,4,Good at 1999 rs only. Cartridge price is more. but you can install ciss system to get affordable prints and easy to refill.
35762,5,"I got this for office work, prints and photo prints at home. Its amazingly user friendly i installed this and use it with laptop. Best part is they hv given both ink cartridges with this. I had A4 size paper with me. Only prob is it doesn't connects with any mobiles as USB point is for laptop or pc. I had to watch YouTube videos though as manual is bakwaas n cd dekhne ka tym nahi hai. But really excellent print outs n fast."
35763,5,"Great multi function printer at a great discounted price. printed picture quality is awesome, but using more ink cartridge than my regular hp printer. buy overall it's a great deal for 1999/-"

35777,4,I got this product on big billion day 2014 for Rs 0.....yes....zero :) Have been using this product since. Works fine till now. The product is shipped with two partially filled cartridges- color and black which is the best thing because once your cartridges are finished you need around 2000 rs to buy new pair of cartridges. Refilling is also an option and work up to around 10 times on black but clarity will be on the downside. The main disadvantage is the ink consumption. Each time printer...
35778,4,"It is my heartful review about the product. I bougth this product last month at a resonable price of Rs.2500 and after expering its performance for a month I'm writing this.

35782,3,"Got a printer - All in one - for a steal!! Less than 3k is just good. That too, Canon. Performance is good but i am sure the ink is going to cost a lot. Hope it gives sufficient prints on a full cartridge. What i don't like about it is, it makes a lot of noise when fetching the paper in order to start printing. First i felt as if some part is broken. It was too loud. But then i realized, it is maybe because of the cost cutting that some things were compromised. Another issue is that it doesn'..."

It has few important features like coping, scanning etc. This product is worth to buy but the greatest drawback will lye on its cartridge. One black cartridge cost around Rs.800 and it can print only 150 pages so image the printer cost Rs.2400 but the single cartridge cost rs.800 now we can make out how we get ..."

35798,4,I just wanted to print documents once in a while. Not a heavy user so it is good for me. It is light weight print quality is also good. Works fine with macbook. Colour is also good and presentable on any desk. If you are a heavy user or need it for professional prints maybe go for higher end models. Wish it was wireless but cant complain much at the price.
35799,4,"This is a printer for normal use... The photocopy and the print quality are good and clear. It does all my works of printing, scanning and photocopy.

Once we had this printer hooking up was easy with Windows 7 and quick start up and then completing projects by kids was easy.

35829,5,I am already having RICOH laser printer which takes 0.5 paise for printing.As i need scanner this all in function printer is cheaper than scanner and its colour printer also.So i brought this one. Pros: *)Good Scanner and copy function. *)Color Ink depth is good.You can take passport photos at home. *)Scanning speed is good but Its OK..Not too fast as it needs 20-40 secs. *)Printing speed is better than HP. Cons: *)Slow speed of color printing and Black and white printing is some what faste...
35830,5,hi friends this multifunction printer is very good at working.it is an amazing product....i really love this.its the best product in the range of 2k.every thing is fine with this product but a small pron is that the catridge is a bit costlier to buy....
35831,3,printer is in good condition and its worth of price i got this only for 1800 . by purchasing through mobile app. and this printer is only suitable for home purpose.
35832,5,"It has amazing printing quality to its price value and its light weighted.. Amazing packing by Flipkart. If u r budgeted and looking for a nice printer with all in 3-in-one facility then, this is the best choice. 5 stars"
35833,5,Flipkart delivered this product before in time and in good condition ........... everything is fine ......regarding print quality it is ok and best suit for home purpose......
35834,5,Flipkart delivered this product in 4 days. Nice Packing. Printing quality and Photo Print Speed is too good. We cant expect more in this Budget. It crops scanned docs automatically. Its really nice feature time. Overall I m very satisfied with this. And Coming to Ink Cartridges cost is very high. Better to fix ciss ink tank.
35835,5,"This printer (Cannon PIXMA MG2470) provide excellent printout as well as scan quality. It has easy to use feature, simple and clear. The software provide easy to use function. The packing is excellent an there is no damage even to the cardboard cover"
35836,3,"i received this printer much before the standard delivery date, kudos to flipkart for fastest delivery.  The Product is a good and user friendly, however very slow in printing in comparison to HP all in one printer also the INK received along with printer gave hardly 70 prints in Black and white before it finished, Colour print wasn't used much hence not sure about how long it will last and price for a black ink cartridge is approximately between 800- 900 rupees.  The Scanner works pretty wel..."
35837,5,I received the printer with excellent packing & with well managed system. I unpacked & gave trail colour print out of Ashtavinayak wikepedia.Excellent prints came out. I am happy with printer and service also.  Thanks & Regards. Sujit Kulkarni. For Renuka Tech
35838,4,Prints slowly but an awesome choice at a reasonable price. Highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a printer at home. Flipkart does a great job in delevering the product on time with minimum hassle.
35839,5,The most important thing is it has a refill friendly cartridge which according to me is a very important feature in the current market...the print quality is good...the scan quality is awesome..flipkart gave it to me within 16 hours..by which i was totally surprised...a must buy cuz its too good a machine for this price...
35840,5,Pros: Cost: The MRP is 3995-/ but in flipkart is cost 2990.  Was well packed and got it on time.  It can be attached to your PC/Tablet.  Easy to configure and use. Drivers can also be found online.  Auto Power On/Off  Cons Printing takes more time
35841,5,very good
35842,5,"Canon pixma printer is easy to use , lightweight, with xerox, and with both colour and black and white print out and xerox."

35860,5,Nice Product
35861,4,Nice. good quality printer from canon..
35862,1,After 10-20 copies the cartridge gets empty. You will have to buy a new ink cartridge @ RS 499 from Flipkart. So apparantly you will end up paying RS 25 per copy.
35863,2,"Hi, this is Javed Who Purchased & Used this product since last 5 months, it is very good in pricing but it is very very bad in terms of maintaining, i mean it's ink, TOO COSTLY."

35873,4,Product is very good....and good quality .... Packing was horrible...
35874,4,"cartridges are provided with this printer at the time in box package or not, because this is not specified in the sales"
35875,2,Cartridge is costier than printer...only 30 prints from the cartridge....Don't buy it...Spend more money in other products
35876,5,amazing and super thank you filpkart
35877,5,very good printer. printing quality is too good.
35878,1,Please don't buy this printer.. the cartridge gets over after 20 prints and scanner sometimes strucks I would like to say you to go for a ink tank printer where you can add inks..
35879,2,wow after 8 months usage i sold this coz iNk prices 60% of the amount of printer !! Keep calm store money go with laser jet or something else which cartridge supports refilling QQ
35880,5,v good product
35881,1,Dont buy this product guys this canon peoples are cheeters they dont know to manufacture the good product. i purchased 1 month back this printer. but no use boz it hase mentioned in to the cartrage that you can take 400 print were i took only 10 it showes cartrage is empty and i buyed new one that also same only 10. stop this selling product in to the market. now i need to through this printer to dustbin. do not buy it
35882,5,good
35883,4,Good
35884,5,nice work
35885,5,very very very very good super
35886,5,too good
35887,1,by using two to three months its getting problems...
35888,5,Very good product
35889,1,Not working properly..
35890,5,well finished pakage and the printer so u can buy it in cheap price.
35891,5,this product as good
35892,1,please do not sale
35893,1,Its cartage will cost you a bomb.Lasts just 10 prints & costs Rs 800/-. Not worth it. Print quality is ok
35894,5,I take print in my hand really very nice
35895,4,"GOOD, GOOD , GOOD"
35896,1,Not able to print. Alarm lamp is continuously blinking despite correct installation of cartridges and paper alignment.
35897,1,I did not even give it one star .Very worst product. color print and black print does not print 10 pages also and it shows running on low ink . Never expected this from flipkart . I can't return it . Bad experience from flipkart. Worst printer ever .
35898,5,"Best Printer Under Budget Fast Printing , Light Weight LOVE THIS PRODUCT"
35899,2,The Black color cartridge can print only around 50-60 papers after that we need to buy a new one which cost around 800.  The print quality is good the cost of refilling is too high
35900,5,I received good product iam satisfied let see the span
35901,5,Looking good and working system is very nice.
35902,5,nice value for money but it is not connect mobile to print
35903,5,Nice..
35904,5,good
35905,1,One cartridge costs around 600(medium) and i am getting 15-18 pages per cartridge ..so approximately i am paying 30rs for a page printout. If you are looking for a scanner...fine go for it. price of printer is inversely proportional to rs you pay for pages. Go for some printer in range of 6k to 7k. In long term you will reap benefit.
35906,4,it works properly.good product must buy
35907,2,good working
35908,5,Realy very nice product. Love it.
35909,3,"Quality is good. Two catridges are to be used. Cost is more (black1000,colour700). Not suitable for home needs."
35910,1,Very poor quality of product.As printer was delivered in time but it's a defective as its not working I have placed request for replacement but they have not responded to it and saying it request is rejected .So friends don't buy any thing from flipkart they are selling defective product and showing arogant behaviour with customers and return policy is very poor.
35911,5,Canon prefect
35912,5,good quality
35913,1,for 1 month it is best printer but after one month it is so costly ink was RS.1000-2000

35931,4,Printer is working fine and output is also great but it is a ink eater eats lots of ink for a couple of pages. . Cartridges prices are sky high.Thus giving 4 stars.  Canon should at least think of its consumers a bit.

36087,2,Good printing but cartridge is not maintaining briter ink capability
36088,4,Good product in this price. It is very good on use and quality.
36089,1,"It's a cheating seller , don't buy,"
36090,5,The printer is very good for printing and scanning @ home use. But its ink is expensive.
36091,1,"the performance of this printer in not good, printing speed is really bad and the main problem is the cartridge, it costs you too much every time and also not worth of the price."
36092,1,I have bought this product from flipkart just 4-5 weeks back and I am putting it up on OLX right away. 1. The scanner stops working if your ink runs out. Which is stupid because 2 functions should operate independently (like in HP - i should stuck to the same) 2. One ink cartridge gives only 6-7 full colour prints (i only use it to print pictures for my kid's school projects)\ Very annoying product.
36093,1,hello! please dont buy it this canon printer your lost your money printer is gud but cartage is so expensive colour pirice 1200 and black 1000. total cost 2200 printer cost 2300 and only 180 pages printe in one cartage

36289,3,"Didn't meet expectations. Need to refill very frequently. While refilling it flows out from other end. Very less amount of ink remains inside cartridge resulting in printing for 15-20 papers only. And other issue is, even after refilling cartridge the yellow light will keep blinking. Would say don't go for this product."

36326,1,Never by this product. It is really swindling to rob the credulous customers by selling them a comparatively cheaper printer and then to charge an exorbitant and unaffordable and grossly disproportionate price for the printer cartridges. The printer is never returnable as well. NEVER EVER BUY AND FALL A PREY TO THE SELLERS CUNNING TACTICS.
36327,1,Very bad product. Cartridge finish within 20 pages print. And the cartridge is not refilling. If the cartridge is finished you need to buy a new cartridge Which price is 700 and above. And no. off-page is very less in printing. Almost your per copy print approx Rs10-12 each in black.
36328,1,Printer bad working
36329,1,Very poor not working ink error .even after refilling
36330,5,This printer is very nice
36331,5,"Frankly speaking Guyzz don't buy this as for student purpose/home purpose because the cartridges is too costly and in one cartridge give only 50 sheets Afterall the printer is very good there is no doubt but not for as student purpose overall cost will be 10,000 in that you go for ink tank printers it will save you atleast you don't have to buy costly cartridges. Thank you ."

37319,1,Please don't buy this product. 1 took only one print then it's stopped to work
37320,1,It is not good
37321,1,After using 1 year I am writing  Product seems to good but it make you to spend more money to purchase New cartridges  Believe me never think to purchase it  It's very less efficient for avg class people Cartridges cost you approximately 15-18 hundreds of rupees  Print quality is not good as laser printer  After refilling not expect to see good results  It's very very very bad product it's not allowed you to scan after ink of cartridges goes less
37322,5,Spr
37323,5,Very good quality and nice model Satisfied
37324,2,"Printer works fine, but i would recommned not to buy this as the cartridges are very expensive."
37325,2,Don't buy it. The reason is printer cartige is very costly. One cartige you will printer 20 or 25 pages only and the cost of Black Cartage is 775/-.
37326,5,Fast delivery... Printer is good quality made in Thailand

37364,3,Printing quality is awesome but the cost of printing is too much so if your printing work is not much then definitely you can go for this but if you have to print more then the cost of cartridge will definitely be high for you as it just prints approax 50 pages in a single cartridge so do consider this point before buying..

40326,2,I have an issue with this printer
40327,4,Good
40328,2,Very high ink consumption. In one black cartridge only 50 prints are printed
40329,3,It is little bit slow but over all performance is good. it is not pocket friendly as very less number of page printing capacity per catriage
40330,5,Just provide demo for printers
40331,4,"I bought this only just 2299/-, it's quite slow but good for educational purposes at home for minute use..."

40358,4,"Printer is cheap for home use, but doesnt print many colour pages, colour cartridge gets over with 25-30prints and max 50 pages of black printouts. Cost of cartridges are equal to the printer itself. Buy it only if you have limited usage of printing, otherwise not worth."
40359,1,actually one star is only by mistake it is not a printer it is only a box like printer its cartrige is very costly 1 page cost is 6 rs. so please dont buy this printer and never suggest is any other person

40438,3,Not bad...
40439,1,I am very happy I can receive my product on the time
40440,2,It is not working properly. Waste of money
40441,1,Worst product I have ever get from Flipcart. It's Ink toner has less capacity of ink & very costly to purchase. Can't be refilled. So you have to purchase the toner each time. Approx cost per toner is Rs.600. We can print only 100 to 130 pages per toner. Almost 6 rupees per page. So I suggest not to buy this printer.
40442,5,"after using it for some time i realised , laser printers are always economical than ink ones.."
40443,5,Good quality product
40444,5,Good product for thank you Canon & Flipcart

40594,1,Not for Business use. The cartridge gets over ever 10 pages print and it actually don't print after that. I had to refill everytime and then finally I just kept this printer on scrap and started using HP. Waste of money.
40595,4,Good For Home Use Consumes Ink Very Fast
40596,3,Ink exhausted too early. Improvement requires on driver software. The Printer became unserviceable within 3 years which was not acceptable to me. It seems there is a logic circuit in the Printer which prevents any more print facilities after a certain number of pages has been printed by the system.

It is better to read these reviews before purchasing a canon printers. The cost of the printer is some how less but the cartridges cost is extremely high and from each cartridge we can't take printouts more than 50 pages. Better go for Laser Jet Printers with Toner cartridges."

41084,3,It consume ink very fast. Cartridge come with this printer are empty after printing at least 50-60 pages but after replacing new cartridges it can print at least 100 pages. But best in this price for home use. Flipkart gave me lowest price than other shopping sites for this printer. I recommend it for home use only. Not for official. Print quality is best.
41085,1,waste product..once it worked then stopped
41086,1,catrige failure
41087,3,dont buy its catridge cost 1000 i will increase the cost u can buy laser printer
41088,1,I have not purchased it still I'm able to write a review...lol pathetic
41089,5,works good
41090,1,"Don't buy this printer. The printer uses more ink (mainly black) which drains so fast, also it cost nearly 900 -1000 whereas an ink toner of hp laser printer (monochrome) cost only 500 -600."
41091,4,Printing is good and user friendly. It has many good features. Only drawback is that Ink Catridge is costly. It costs nearly 1000 Rs. If you fill ink manually it costs only 150 to 200 only. Otherwise printer is good.
41092,1,Very bad printer

41094,5,Perfect to make it with ciss
41095,5,Best printer.

41107,1,"Worst product with respect to ink, but I have found a way to refill the cartridges."
41108,5,"Printer not working , seller not replacment , and refund money filpkart not care ?"
41109,5,Nice
41110,3,Quite simply
41111,4,"Printer is good, carriage are expensive, hence printing cost is high, good for limited usage."
41112,1,Flipkart is amazing but the product is truly waste of money and time as well. Please don't buy this product. I had worst experience to the same.
41113,1,"This proudct are very poor prfromence , its a very costly"

41119,1,Waste of money don't buy ink cartridge not available
41120,5,Good product in this budget segment
41121,1,"It is worst . very bad experience,it wont work without catridge.It costs rs 1000 and gives 50 prints only. scanner also not work if catridge not connected or new one provided."

41146,1,Very bad printer
41147,5,Cartridges are too small it does not print enough page as according to the capacity as according to the price it is a good product

41184,1,"Don not buy this printer it is waste product,cartridges very high price. canon company worst company, poor peoples very upset who buy this product."

41187,5,"I replaced my Epson TX121 with this due to some unfortunate malfunction. This printer's scanning is simply too good. It is fast, smooth, edge to edge and crisp. Printing is also ok but it does not print till corner of the page. However, I do not know it is because of some setting or it is default. Xerox is also ok. For home users, it is a good printer for just 2400/- Thank you, Flipkart"

41213,1,It's pathetic don't even think of buying it..my printer fizzed out in a month and there's no warranty also..it's scraped now
41214,5,I love it
41215,4,The ink finishes too fast . Else a fab product with good quality scanning and printing . If u have a ink refilling shop near ur home just go for it . It gave me approx 150 pages with both coloured and b/w cartridge refilling .
41216,1,I brought this printer and it is a ink guzzler. One cartridge last not more then 25 prints. Really disappointed. Do ask seller or manufacturer how many pages in black and white does a cartridge print.If you are happy go for it

41509,4,Nice all in one printer
41510,5,its work very nicely. so good
41511,1,Printer is good but cost of ink cartige is high. Printer produces very much noise. The quality of xerox is quite low. OPINION : The ink cartiges can be reuse. When the printer shows INK CARTIGE NOT DETECTING then solder the contacts of ink cartige with very thin layer. INK CARTIGE NOT DETECTING error shows only for the contacts on the cartige get eroded. I think its the policy of company to sold more costly cartiges. Friends i am using this printer for 1 year and i have done this on my cartig...
41512,5,Simply superb
41513,3,Nice product in low price

41610,1,Not good at all.........
41611,5,perfect thing at a cheap cost.
41612,1,Very bad don't buy plz
41613,3,Affordable printer cartridge capacity is less
41614,2,Printing qualty is good bt ink is too xpnsive
41615,3,Prints very less pages. Also cartridge is very cost black 900 and color 1500 and just prints approx 100 pages.
41616,4,Good printer for house use
41617,5,"Excellent product, thanks to the dealer, thanks to flipkart. Like to by 3 more if the product price come down."
41618,1,Worst shopping experience with Flipkart
41619,4,Good
41620,2,Good
41621,2,"It's an average product in terms of speed, works slow. Also the cartridge gets over quickly and is expensive to buy.. prefer a laser printer.."
41622,5,Nice product loved it
41623,1,It takes a lot of ink to print...
41624,1,I feel sorry for the decision to buy this product. Every 15 days I have to buy cartridge. Printer takes too much ink. Every print costs me Rs 10
41625,3,Printer is good. Flipkart delivered it in time. It was packed very nicely. It take some time to start. Printing speed is good. Scanner is also good. Price is also affordable. No dought about product. But cartridege is very costly. only 50-60 prints in one black cartridge. Cartridege price is near about Rs. 1000/- . For 50-60 prints Rs.1000/- is not economical. Company has to solve this cartridge problem. Cartridge prices should be very cheap.
41626,4,I Ordered it seeing its price and features. It is worth every money. GO FOR IT
41627,5,Good
41628,5,Good

41635,4,Useful for home purpose.
41636,4,Color Excelent
41637,5,It's good but should be free ink with pack
41638,4,Wonderful but not attqching to pc
41639,5,Fine quality
41640,5,V.v.v good excellent
41641,4,PRODUCT & DELIVERY ALSO GOOD BUT INVOICE BILL MISSING
41642,1,Not for scanning
41643,5,The product was delivered before the due date and that was amazing. But the only problem is that the ink smudges.
41644,5,Super
41645,2,very less ink in cartridge. It printed few papers only.
41646,1,Bad printer and black and colour carteage is not good don't buy thid product waste of money and wast of timr
41647,3,Printing is good but we must buy ink cartridges frequently.. at high cost . .. Maintaining the printer is costlier than the cost of printer..!
41648,5,REALLY USEFUL -IN THIS COST
41649,5,I got the product on time as mentioned... It is working very well...
41650,5,Fine
41651,5,IT's good its low cost no second thoughts go for it
41652,3,Printer comes with demo Ink . Ink is more costlier than printer.
41653,3,Product is ok not for commercial use but good for personly.
41654,5,good
41655,2,"Quality is good, but maintenance is too high. Too costly cartridge, its better to print from outside, not worth."
41656,3,Product quality is best in class
41657,4,Pretty good
41658,5,Its good... Thankyou flipkart
41659,2,I printed not more than 50-60 pages.. and it indicated low ink sign.. plz dont buy... otherwise its fine with other functions
41660,2,catriages are expensive
41661,4,Excellent budget printer
41662,1,I have purchased by flipcart. Very expensive printing
41663,3,i love it but injector cost is too much and printing only 35 to 50 pages at new
41664,4,This is that best printer in this coust thanks to flipkart
41665,1,Excellencent speed of delivery
41666,4,The quality of scanning and the printing are good. Nice buy for me. It really helps to have a scanner in your home.
41667,3,Nyc Product but Cartairige Not Good ??????????????
41668,3,Though the printer price is low this product very uneconomical product that yields very less number of prints. Cartridge price is very high.
41669,4,it is the best product to children for their personal use.but it gets heated while runnung and the paper jams in between the printt .....but it is the best
41670,5,"Works Fine. It takes a while when ever you starts the printer to print. Worth for the money I have paid. But the cartridge is too costly to replace, need to find out refill mechanism."
41671,3,DEVISE IS GOOD BUT PROVIDED INK QUANTITY IS VERY LESS PRINTING AND XEROX ARE GOOD BUT SCAN IN NOT SUPPORTED
41672,2,It was looking good at flipkart but when i brought it and started using it . I found that it dosent print well. The product was not good at all.
41673,3,THe product service is good but makes lot of noise during printing. Nice product in affordable price. It should be laserjet instead of inkjet.
41674,3,Dont go by the price of this product. Once the ink gets finished u wil hav to pay around 1700 bucks for the new catridges. The catridges within the box are S size. So there is no benefit in paying a amount for catridges which almost equal to the ptoduct-s value.
41675,1,i just print up to 200 pages with black. and cartridge is so high cost. just i loss my all money on this. but this is not value for money product.
41676,1,"One world ""useless"""
41677,1,Worst printer for students in low budget. Useless
41678,3,"Hi friends, this printer first it works good. After few days problems started."
41679,4,It is nice to have a printer at low cost which can do every thing.
41680,4,Very good one. Value for money. Scanner is the best amongst all 3
41681,4,Good printer but ink consumption is high and costly price of ink is more than printer
41682,3,Printer is very good but it has printed only 100 pages to refill it comes same cost of printer
41683,4,"Very nice product in its category with a decent performance in printing ,copy and also in scan.The product reached with in the time."
41684,4,"good, i bought it when it was1800 from flipkart.it worked perfectly,. Only problem is you have to remove and put catridges again and again to make sure it detects. i dont know whther i got fault piece or all such products have such problem. but it works perfectly fine. dont expect ink to long last/. maximum 100 pages black and white and 30 pages colour"
41685,4,"Very useful product, thanks for all the reviewers without whom I wouldnt have chosen this product. Thanks to flipkart for making positive changes in people lives."
41686,5,"Good products delivery, Very fast delivery. I love this printer because this is budget friendly."
41687,5,This one has a full sealed black and colour cartridges on it which if not cost u around 2000 bucks but u r getting it free. great working printer scanner and copier. no flaws
41688,1,GUYS NEVER PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT. BECAUSE : 1- U CAN NOT REFILL THIS CARTRIDGE. THIS IS ONLY ONE TIME USE. I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PRINTER LAST YEAR DIWALI. SINCE THAT I NEVER BOUGHT THIS AND LOST ASSURED FORM FLIPKART IT IS VERY BAD..
41689,2,"i had hp 1050 earlier and was far better than this product... per page printing cost is very high, colour ink level goes down even if you dont use it and there is some some hardware issue too as many times i have to reset it as it shows some error 5100 randomly. in short not a good product"
41690,1,printing quality is good but the printer can be considered as free of cost. The money charged is for inks cartridges. Cartridges are same cost as new printer.
41691,5,delivery is good in time for ws retailer on flipkart and product is good . just a suggestion i u can give combo offers on printers with ink and extended warrenty
41692,4,nice product. canon is always good. :-) handy for students and all domestic purpose.. All the 3 functions work very well.
41693,4,its good i used it almost 6 hour continuously.but i don't have any problem. follow the manual everybody will use it so easily other wise connect canon India.they too help u.there is nothing problematic that u bought it from a online shopping store actually its good. i will give 7 out of 10
41694,5,Excellent product Perfect for budget Print quality is excellent As cartridge is small I use additional inks to fill the cartridge.
41695,4,Delivery was on time .Its easy to install and use. Prinitng quality and speed is good .I use this printer for my submission and college work. it is reliable. o
41696,1,"Printer is not recognized by the computer, giving error message as printer drivers not installed properly, tried multiple time but no luck."
41697,4,"I don't know about cartridge, But currently it's working fine for me. Able to Print, Copy and Scan documents."
41698,5,"First of all, I strongly recommend you guys to buy this product, This is a awesome printer. As, you can see in description that this product gives, around 180 pages, but in actual it give 250 colour pages and 220 black pages approximately. Please go for it even thinking for a sec."
41699,1,"product was good.delivery was fast asusual.bt ink is costly than printer itself..... so dont buy...ifstill want to buy this dont purchase ink bt buy a new printer every time , take out ink cartidges n selll brand new printer"
41700,5,Bought it in a scheme...useful for me as i do less printing. Print is of good quality and overall satisfaction is good
41701,5,i found this printer awesome .its definitely the same which i desired thanku flipkart for your wonderful service.........
41702,5,my order was cancelled i have order the canon injet printer . it was cancelled by flipkart .. i need my order its my request
41703,3,Received the product from Flipkart earlier than schedule delivery time. Printer was Easy to install. Printer driver downloaded from CANON. Easy operate and cons are that cost per page and drying on non-use.
41704,5,"I have brought this printer two weeks before. The print quality of this printer is very good both color print and black print. The printer having many function like we can scan,copy and print the documents. As per price printer is too much good.  I have printed more than 50 papers still the cartage is working properly."
41705,4,"After checking the functions (copy, scan,print) Mg 2470 printer good enough for home purpose.. best buy at rs. 2000.color print quality also good. overall am satisfied."
41706,5,Awesome printer and the print quality is awesome guys i loved it
41707,4,i got it rs 1899 via this special link :- http://fkrt.it/WwPkWNNNNN thanks to flipkart  ok   THKZ i love flipkart   o
41708,1,"The print quality is good, but the cartridge provided with the printer is very low quantity. It ran out within less than 50pages. Highly disappointed with it."
41709,5,nice product to use it. the product from WS is the best product. you can buy the product and from it.
41710,5,Dont Buy 2570 But Buy This Model B'cause All Specifications Are Same And 2470's Price Is Low. Good Picture Quality even In Photo. I Recommend this to every one.
41711,5,The printing quality is amazing and the scanning and copying functions are a plus point. All this for just Rs.2199 is a steal deal. It was delivered within 48 hours ensuring the good flipkart service and it was packed quiet neatly.
41712,5,I've been using this since i've purchased and i never felt disappointed on the print. So i can say that this Inkjet printer is good and has awesome picture quality. I don't say that this is the best but i can say that this is good. Thank you flipkart.
41713,5,Good product..working good right choice to buy this thank you flipkart..
41714,4,Easy installation and easy print. But taking 15-20 secs for color copies. Product quality is average but functionality wise very good.
41715,3,Good product... Fair price... . Bt only one problem... the ink cartridge is much costly and ink wont last long...
41716,1,It is a multi functioned ink jet which works good but curtrige finished very fast . new curtrige most costly .
41717,5,the printer was very helpful to me as I need to go to the stationary and wait for my chance for printing but only at home only I can take out my prints as now it is winter than it is very difficult for me to go and wait for printer . I AM VERY HAPPY
41718,4,"for refilling of black cartridge or color cartridge, refill it y making a hole deep inside of the cartridge. but your printer will still show you error. then just press stop button for 30 second and left it.........some time it gave me headache. then call your customer service engineer, when he look at your home asked him directly all the problems. but dont say on phone."
41719,4,"Canon MG2470 is the exact device needed by me - printer, scanner and copier with WiFi connectivity. The quality of prints is pretty good considering the price for the printer. However the ink cartridge did not last even 40 prints."
41720,5,"it have good print quality ,but it produced little noise when printing time,scan quality is average,i got the product @price of 1999 on diwalie offer.i like the ws retailer also.they provided good packing and quality product"
41721,4,Good printer at amazing price . only concern is price of cartridges.
41722,4,Use only home.....print very costly
41723,5,"The only con I faced was downloading the Mac drivers separately.  Best Printer/Scanner at this price, its practically a steal."
41724,5,canon software is pretty good... scanner working fastly and scans very clear images... i satisfy by this price .....
41725,4,Very fast delivery..and the product is very good..the printing quality is also surprising..
41726,4,This printer scanner copier is very good for home use since i have a canon lbp2900b laserjet allb/w is done there the colored part is done here printing speed is less -can manage with a budget printer catridge price is more -negative  the user software is very user friendly  it prints a limited amt of pages  the catridges given with the printer are test only catridges the empty soon dont worry the ones u buy wont get over soon  Thank You !
41727,5,the product is great in such a low price offered by flipkart... !!! extremely happy the product's performance ... and it was delivered in 1 day... !!! if you are looking for deals in this range ... you should go for this product ... !!!
41728,5,Canon PIXMA MG2470 All-in-One Inkjet Printer IT WAS AN GOOD PRODUCT I LOVE THIS SHIPPING ALSO GOOD
41729,4,"good for regular home usage.make a little noise while printing,but you have to compromise at this price rate.printing quality for document printing is good.so over all a 4 star."
41730,5,Good offer by Flipkart.. But it is only useful for home purpose for limited prints as Ink consumption is very fast
41731,4,IT IS NICE BUT DOES NOT WORK WITH ANDROID KITKAT INK CARTRIDGE ARE VERY EXPENSIVE IT HAS 3.5 ML NOZZLE WHEREAS HP DESKJET 5 ML
41732,4,"its a good printer - small & perfect for home use/ personal use, good quality prints. Only problem is that the number of prints per cartilage/ink refill is very bad."
41733,1,canon pixma is not good because there is very high cartilage cost.there is very slow printing and bad scanning.
41734,3,"I am using this printer from last 2 months but after 10-20 print, the Cartridge indication shows that the ink is very low and also every time i am facing a problem that the printer will not taking input paper for print, when a user commends Print then printer shows that Ink is Empty Or Not Taking Paper Inside Properly"
41735,5,nice product at reasonable price .............................................................................................................................
41736,5,the cost of new cartridge is high i prefer to buy hp printers and also not scan big size than A4 papers such as legal.
41737,4,"The printer is quite impressive and quality of output is also excellent. Particularly scanning quality and color printing quality is excellent. However I found one problem, don't know how it occurred, but cartilages (particularly black cartilage) is not working well. I have taken merely 40-50 prints (including both color and grey-scale) and it is showing error with black color quantity and also not letting me to take any black and white printouts. Rest all is OK!!"
41738,2,this is very cheap price than quality of printer & seller v good product m using it without any problem if any one want i can share him any printed picture by this printer.
41739,4,"Printer quality is not that good, but scanner is very nice. Takes time to load and start up. Scanner works quite good. Worth buying product. and cheaper."
41740,5,I was quiet skeptical about the product till I received it.The prints were amazing.I don't have to rush for photocopy.My kids projects are now being completed even in odd hours from the comfort of my home.Good job Flipkart!
41741,4,"The 3 in 1 does what its meant to do with ease.  Pros: Lightweight Speed Easy to Operate  Cons: Nothing major, just that it consumes too much ink."
41742,5,I am using this product....print quality is very good...in this price this is very best for home use.
41743,5,Its a Very Good Printer against price category....... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Perfectly designed for home use.
41744,4,"print quality is good, best for personal use, some time it pick more than one page at a time, overall it's good."
41745,1,"This printer is only for scanning if you print copies the cartridge will exhaust soon, taking Xerox and printing copies at internet centre are very much cheaper than printing from this printer"
41746,4,fine good con good scan good print good multifun smail price good worth good product. good product Canon PIXMA MG2470 All-in-One Inkjet Printer
41747,5,The Printer Speed is awesome in Black & White mode. The colour printing speed is also very good. I have printed Photographs on Photo Paper . The Quality is very nice. I am very satisfied with the printer
41748,5,"Before buying the calculation I made was I thought of any of the following: printing 1000 pages/scanning 500 pages/xeroxing 2000 pages would be enough to cover my purchase cost, and it didnt fail me."
41749,5,Canon PIXMA MG2470 All-in-One Inkjet Printer a very good product in low cost amazing color quality.the trey can hold 60 pages at a time .

41752,5,Was delivered within 24 hours. What I got with this very neat looking printer -  1. connecting cables 2. color + black ink cartridges   Ideal for home use. Good product. And the price was a steal.  Cheers to Flipkart :)
41753,1,"i like this product but if i pucrchase online its totally time waste bcoz flipkart executives said item would be replace but if i say yes then they will pick-up old iten in 3 days, after that they will send the new product.. so they will take minimum 6 days for delevry 6 3=9 days i will have to wait.. so why they cant send only cartridge.. bcoz if they send only cartridge i will have to wait only 2 to 6 days.."
41754,4,"Ordered this product on Tuesday night and got it delivered on Thursday noon! Wow Flipkart! And packing was supreme.. Speaking about the product itself, it is a real VFM but its not built to last which is the only flaw in an otherwise, a great product. Seamless printing, copying and of course those Scans! Very easy to install and use. Except for those regular snags that come associated with inkjet printers, it has nothing to complain about..  I say Go for it.."
41755,4,"Its a nice, easy to use.printer. The only small irritation could be the sound created while loading paper. Worth buying."
41756,5,"product is good and earlier i have used EPSON,HP in same category and from that side it is a nice one but the delivery process by flipkart is not so good.I am not writing the detail about the delivery process over here."
41757,2,"ACCORDING TO PRICE ITS OK ,BUT THERE NEED TO BE SOME IMPROVEMENT IN SOFTWARE AFTER INSTALLING HE DEVICES SPECIALLY IN GLOSSY PAPER IT PRINT IN A4 SIZE, SINCE USING IT FORM 3 DAYS. AT SEE WHAT GOOD OR BAD THINGS COME OUT."
41758,1,"i brought it two days earlier but today it is not working properly.please not purchase it . so, poor performance."
41759,1,"bad model , not at all user friendly at all and have lot of issues needless to say about the issues please dont buy this perticular model"
41760,3,"good for home use, cost of cartridge high,non refill , approx 50-60 prints only.easy operating oooooooooookay"
41761,2,its amazing with black and colour cartriage packed very well with extra air seal packs for extra support
41762,4,I actually bought it to use for my own purpose of printing on occasional need. I Love the working of the printer.
41763,1,"Printer running with good condition but now a day they don't have show black ink and they are not print above. they have 1 year canon warranty. please do needful to product, faces lot of problem to printing."
41764,1,It cannot print photo on a A4 size photo paper and it leaves a large border on page which is wastage of paper. It can only print photo on a 4R or 4 inch X 6 inch paper
41765,4,"Its light, compact and great. The delivery was quick and installation was very quick. Wish the connector cable between the PC and the printer could be a bit longer. Its worth buying."
41766,1,bad...bad worst product......it costs Rs.1000 for a black in....which gives u approx 100 print.....i was a fool that i bought this one...if you wanna another fool then please buy this jhandu printer....& make your life hellllllll.....good for even not nothing.......
41767,3,the printer is excellent and the prints are also very good.....but the cartridge cost is very much expensive compared to other hp printers............
41768,1,"Canon Printer is very bad , only HP printer is best . plz dont buy canon printer . only buy HP company printer for work"
41769,3,"price wise item is very good, but very soon the cartidge of the printer will be empty. if refill of cartige will success then ok, if not then you have to purchase it again by rupee near about 1k"
41770,3,"Printing quality is very good. Scanner is not of high resolution but o.k. This machine also works like a photo state machine. Since its an inkjet printer, number of pages can be printed per cartridge may be low."
41771,1,"Please don't buy, INK hardly last for a couple of prints. The cartridge is damn costly, Replacing both cartridges costs almost equal to buying another printer. And if you think refilling is an option. The refill ink easily leaks through the bottom, creating an error in the printer. Which in turn voids the warranty. Please don't waste your money."
41772,1,i have purchased this product for 1843 odd . it wont give hardly 25 pages at least.even refilling is undesirable. now i am using it only for scanning which is good .in total I won't recommend to buy this.
41773,1,After using it 6 months i can say that it is waste of money its cartridge cost is too high...please dont buy
41774,5,"Excellent Product ""Canon PIXMA MG2470 All-in-One Inkjet Printer"".  Received ordered product immediately in 3days. Checked the functions of the Printer working fine."
41775,2,"i use this product, but not 100% satisfied with this. functioning properly, good at this price but its very Ink Hungry Printer.  Ink Eat at Very High Speed.  May be 50 pages print with one ink cartage ."
41776,3,ink cartidge is too small extra page margin non refilable ink new ink cartidge is costly then printer so buy with a smart decison
41777,5,"Very good experience.  I have not noticed any loss in ink cartridge ever after printing many pages as many reviewers have suggested.  All the functions are working as they are supposed to, printing quality is very good. I am fully satisfied with the product. The most amazing part is its price."
41778,3,i am using this printer for multi purpose... mostly scanning and color printing.. SUPER SPEED SCANNER... various resolution it will take in few seconds... good printing Quality...Especially for SCANNING...
41779,5,"Very good price , multiple use gr8 deal.Very good product in cheap priceVery good product in cheap price"
41780,5,"If you are looking for an all-in-one device, this is the best investment you can make. Apart from the expensive cartridges, the device will work as you expect it to.  Scanner - 5/5 Printer - 5/5 Quality - Excellent"
41781,5,"Flipkart delivbery on time. No issues with setup.  Pros: canon has made a product with valid instructions and it was ready in no time.  Cons: Needs drivers for installation, no plug n play. Software has many features, but should have had a lite version. I will not use 80% of these. Rest all is fine."
41782,4,"i have bought this product 2 months back. the basic problem with this inkjet printer is that the ink cartridge empty very quickly so dont buy inkjets when u have more to spend, otherwise it is affordable at a nominal price along with others functions of scanning, and xerox."
41783,1,"FOR PROPER UTILITY OF ANY PRODUCT OF THIS KIND, A DEMO BY A SKILLED TECHNICIAN SHOULD BE INITIATED. FOR TECHNICAL SOFTWARE ISSUES, INSTALLATION ISSUES AND UTILITY ISSUES IF ANY."
41784,1,"iam useing it .ink is not suffitient, aproximate 50 copies only ......................................................................................................................................................"
41785,4,Good Printer Print is so good but its Catridge price is some what high Printer is suitable for home and office use
41786,1,"Don't buy it, simply waste of money and worst product.. The cartridge ckt shorts every time.. Expensive cartridge.."
41787,5,"This is best product in cheap prize. 3 functions(Scanning, Printing and copying), fast printing and scanning process."
41788,2,I got this Billion day sale. It took time setting up the printer. Gets the work done. But uneconomical considering per Page print cost.  Ease of use 3/5 INK consumption 2/5 Economy 2/5
41789,5,east or west this printer is the best sooo gooooooooood swettttt and hooott very very usefull product
41790,3,ok product........  good for basic use.................  over all average........................................................................
41791,4,"Go head with this product easy to take the copies and scanning purposes, but cartridges getting dry soon, If you use in light mode it stays for a long."
41792,5,"I bought it for purpose of scanning older docs n papers. I bought it at 2000/-. Really worth of price I spent.  those who r looking for scanner, xerox n Print Both clor n B&W, I suggest this for sure for home use.  color print quality is good.  some people wrote it lags for Fax etc.,  those features r not possible to fit in this price range. and users can install softwares for the functions like fax etc.."
41793,4,"Good at that price,but not better it make much sound while printing,scanning and even in xerox also........"
41794,5,i bought it for my childern for their school work and it is very useful to them and for me nice product at areasonable price
41795,1,"This printer will not print on systems other than Windows. On my computer, it prints neither on Linux nor FreeBSD. On Windows, the ink-efficiency is pathetic - I got only 25 pages of B/W printouts before the cartridge dried up. The scanner is software-based and works only under Windows. Stay away from Canon. This company is another Microsoft stooge."
41796,4,Print quality is OK....... Cartridges drain faster than the speed of light.......... But you can go for refills.... which also gives quite good results
41797,5,"nice printer in  would have given 5 stars but rate of the cartilages are very high, printing is good,but the process is quite take some time for everything but at this price what more that we would except from it overall it is an nice product for home uses"
41798,1,printer is working good print quality is also good but the only problem is ink consumption is very high specialy black my one ink is finished after a few days use otherwise product is good for home use
41799,4,i bought it this week.and its so far good.took almost 200 pages.and good part is ink works well even at low ink status unlike hp ink.scanner to good.over all nice product at this price.
41800,4,it a good product for home use at a unbelivable price thanks to flipcart i always prefer flipcar for online shoping it is a googd experiance for me and my family isuggest all of you go for flipcar.....
41801,5,It does what it says!!!! Lastly thanks to Flipkart!!!! I would rather say go for it however not for professional printer user......
41802,5,"vey nice printer at low cost with all features, print quality is vey good also scan quality is also very good"
41803,5,Its is a great printer.It is quite good.Everything is software desing from scan to print.That is one of a good point atleast for me. People have critised abt it but for me its asum.Prefect for home use at just Rs 2099..Thanks Flipkart.
41804,4,"i have used this for home use and its excellent its quality is good, it is very suitable for home use.it also print colored and black and white color."
41805,3,"It is a good product for that budget. All in one is really all in one. Print quality is good. Scanner is fully functional.I have been using it for last 2 months, till now no problem such. Though i had to replace the first product. But now i am satisfied."
41806,5,iam using this printer and iam very much satisfied with it an i bought it for 1792 as an offer so according to its price its very affordable
41807,2,this printer is faulty .I buy this printer before 2 week and i print only 24 pages and cartridge is empty. so don't buy this product.
41808,3,Till yet not used...so no comment..later will give right view . But packing were good & delivered on time .
41809,5,"I have bought it just 2 weeks back. It easy to operate, convenient. So far so gud. Will update this, a month later."
41810,5,Does everything good. No bad experiences.  Works upto the expectations.  Scan resolution is great. Print quality of photo and plain paper is uncompromized after cartridge head alignment.
41811,4,product is good but packing is no so good at all  printer works good for my lap without any problem..................................................................................................................
41812,4,"Getting it in discount is nice, however being a inkjet printer it can only be used for emergency purpose at home, but scanner function can be used in usual way, however does not have automatic function in taking papers."
41813,5,"I feel it is easier to assemble the cartridges, and installing the software. Very easy to operate. The multi functions copier and the printer are very useful."
41814,5,no issues and prints like magic only thing is rate of print is slow   if not for that every thing else works smooth  easy to put it together
41815,3,nice printer... it s so good for this price section.... i am feel happy.. any one want low cost printer select this one..
41816,5,Needed a small printer for home for occasional printing. Had a similar HP before but that ink dried twice coz I left it idle for couple of weeks. What a waste that was! So this time it's Canon's turn and so far haven't been disappointed. Installed quite easily and does what it's supposed to do.. even after I left it idle for more than 2 weeks. Some people have commented about high printing costs but let me remind you - this printer is for occasional printing/copying/scanning at home coz you d...
41817,5,great product. working fine. printing quality is also excellent. I just want to focus on one thing and i.e. the cartridge is too costly.
41818,5,"The product was delivered in just 2 days. Light weight machine, Easy to install, print quality is good. Overall good product. Thanks to canon and Flipkart"
41819,4,This printer is so usefull and at a good price. so it is preety good for me. This comes with multiple facility that i like........
41820,5,"We have to install the package provided in the CD which installs drivers and software's. For scanning, we can scan and save it in our desired folder. The software has many other options as well. For copy, in a click of a button, we get the a xerox (color/black & white). Since it easier, even aged people can operate with it. For printing, it just straight-forward."
41821,1,This is really highly useless and outdated product. The support on this by Canon is not available. money waste friends DO NOT BUY THIS
41822,4,hi frnds i get canon pixma printer its nice wroking printer u do not get this type of multi functional printer at this price gud printer to have it ....the week point is cartridge is bit costly but gud for home purpose.....
41823,5,Rs. 1942/- m aur kya logo...frnds...  nic offer frm flipkart...  with two catrigde one is colour and black ....but catrigde rate bit costly ...black is 800 and colour is 1100 rs ....anyways printer small and awesome ...
41824,4,"It is very good for home use. Very cheap multipurpose printer. Better for emergency printing, scanning, copying both color and B/W. Because it consumes more ink. Cartridge costs more."
41825,4,Good Printer But uses More INK Scanning Systerm really nice Printing speed Takes 14-18 seconds I Reccomend This Printer But ink Is so Costly
41826,4,Good.. scan is good.. sample prints looks good....but yet to look for more print outs.............................
41827,4,good va;ue for money.. one drawback that i have found is that ink provided with the package got emptied after printing almost 50 pages..
41828,5,I got this product on Big Bang Sale with a cost of Rs. 0/-  I will give rating 5/5 to this product.
41829,5,Packaging good! Bought on big billion day! delivery within 24 hours!( Bangalore buyers you dont need (in-a-Day at all)  Good product quality is clean! I retro fitted liquid cartridges saw it on YouTube. Printed 340 pages ! economically @85 paise a print! Color costs would be 4/- a page roughly
41830,5,Friends if u r going to buy a printer for lowest cost Pls just go ahead with this it is Quite Good and power ful It has Three in One.... A small one with all in all...
41831,5,"purchased this for 0 rupees on Flipkart. For the price i'd say the printer is really good. As for people claiming the printer is slow its as fast as a inkjet can get. The print result is actually decent, have tried printing pictures on glossy paper and the results have been great"
41832,2,Printing is very slow ink doesn't last long  scan and print quality if fine ok for occasional printing
41833,1,"I have ordered many products from Flipkart and was always happy with quality and fast delivery. This is the first time I received a defective product and to my surprise this printer was struggling to power on. It's an all-in-one printer but nothing worked. Power light kept flashing continuously. After I installed the software and connected the printer, got an error that says ""printer needs to be repaired"". I am sure this piece might have failed the quality check but somehow made it to wareho..."
41834,3,I was supposed to receive this printer on October 10th but got it on 19th October. The packing was bad. It was not expected from flipkart.  Anyway Regarding the Printer:  Pro's Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! It is not heavy and as good as portable.  Cons' Very poor Quality of Print. Scanning quality not good Will give 100 pages per B/W cartridge and 60 pages for Colour Cartridge.   Plz Dont buy it. And not from Flipkart for sure
41835,4,"Hi, This printer is definitely a good budget printer cum scanner with copy feature. Only drawback is that few portion of side edges of an A4 paper is not coming while scanning. But as always, it was a excellent packaging and one day delivery by WS Retail on flipkart. Thank you Flipkart and WS Retail."
41836,5,"Excellent offer and Delivery by Flipkart, Product was very good and it was a steal for the price of Rs 2800"
41837,4,I was eying for print scan copy thing this came while searching.when i first saw the price of this product i was shocked was only 2799.then i decided to buy this. for the past month or so im using this i feel this is superb for the home usage but the cartridge is very less i think we can print only 100 pages on both color and black cartridge.if you are a high volume user better think of buying laser printer.

41840,5,Got it delivered from fk within a day which is awsome and in 2449k price I don think any cons in the product is worthy of mentioning. Speed of printing is a bit on the slower side.
41841,5,Brought it in deal of day!!! its good for home use but bit slow in printing!!!! found that scanner is good if you use windows scanner (i use win 8.1 os) than the provided software!!
41842,5,This printer i am using is excellent .it scans also nicely.i have printed about 100 pages And it is still working nicely .
41843,4,"This is very good option for Home/Personal use.  Pros: Basic job (PRINT, SCAN) well. Light Weight. Easy Maintainence and Connectivity with my Laptop/Computer because of USB port.  Cons: Paper printing is a bit slow and not too many options for Scanning the image"

41997,1,"It is really surprising how flipkart deliver product, without testing the product. When i receive the Canon Pixma MG2470, after instalation it is not working. When I called the Canon Customer Care, they told that printer is already damage, you have to wait for 7 days to get new parts, because it is not available right now.  I am really confuse, what to do i will replace or wait for 7 days for new parts. It is really pathetic service."
41998,1,Not a good product
41999,1,"I felt horrible experience with service centre, they took more than 25 days in order to repair, first they said it be replaced then after they didn't even give the parts recipt were changed"
42000,5,Awsomr
42001,1,"printer looking good but in that printer printing cost very high approx Rs. 5-6 per page. Its new black cartage PG745 price Rs. 899 and page yield only 180 page.  i think, no any one can buy this printer."
42002,1,"I just bought this printer 2 month ago. Its black Ink hardly lasted 20 pages. In market its cartridge is too expensive. Its better to take print out from Market . Its new cartridge don't even last 80 pages and cost of cartridge is 800 bucks . market print out cost is 2 rs . So even you get product in free don't buy. In longer terms it will be damn expensive , better to go with HP. What i learnt after buying this product is check out for cost of cartridge how much pages it will last.Even that..."
42003,3,The item is genuine but it take ink make more consumption or cost to you.
42004,1,Ink cartridge cost is more expensive per page Please dont buy this product... You can go for HP

42008,4,not worh as if you are looking to print 5-10 pages a month at maximum than you can buy because of canon and flipkart else it is not worth. 50-60 pages and cartrage over. scanner is very good. 2 star for scanner and easy installation plus look.
42009,1,"I brought this printer for 2,300/- in Hyderabad.there is no value for this printer without catridge, cartridge can not working if you fill it,you have to buy new one every time,which costs single black colour only is Rs.950 to 1050. Use and throw away item.if you buy both color and black means it's cost you more than a printer cost,"
42010,1,Received the product next day of ordering and the product is faulty and showing Erorr 5011 And Erorr -5100.  Worst service from flipkart. It took around 10-20 calls to customer care to convince them to return the product and initiate my refund.  This was my last order from flipkart.
42011,1,It is useless and wastage of money. After using one week I have to sell in kabadi shop....
42012,4,Very good. ..............work ..............easy. ..work ......l love. ..
42013,5,"After placing order, the printer delivered within a narrow span, as soon the installation took place, an error '5011' occurred, I wrote regarding the matter with the request to replace the machine. An executive talked and assured me to solve the matter, got a massage for pickup, and there after the new machine has been delivered within a short span too. And now it is working nicely. Hats off to ""Flipkart""."
42014,5,One of the best printers I have seen . excellent delivery by Flipkart.

42018,1,"Received the product on 5th April Called flipkart customer care & asked them when installation will be done, he said that you can do it by yourself. But the printer showed some error i guess 5011(Something like that), so i again called Flipkart CC and another executive told me to wait for 48 hour, you will get a call for installation, but again no call after 2 days also. So, I again called Flipkart customer care to ask them if someone would be coming for installation or i want to return this..."
42019,1,This Printer Just prints 100 page at a time.Also it shows error even though the catridge is filled fully
42020,1,Very bad product...........very frustrating product.....about 50-60 pages can be printed from 1 ink box
42021,4,Prompt delivery and product exactly as described. Good product at minimum prices. Got value for money.
42022,5,Always a good experience with flipkart. Great product plus delivery on time. kudos to you guys..
42023,1,"I bought after saw very low prices 2400, they will give youbdemo catridge whcih will take around 30 pages, then after you have to purchase from market good quality will coat you around 900 for single catridge. And to your horror stationery guys will tell you it can't be refilled that means every time you have to buy new one so guys take your decisions wisely."

42031,1,"Price of printer = Its ink cartridges ( Yes, its true ! ) Infact sometime ink cartridges cost more than its price. I talked to canon about number of pages it can print (180) with a set of new cartridges..now here is the math I did.. color ink - INR 1355 (CL746) black ink - INR - 899 (PG745) Total cost - 2254 Now you can not use 100% of this ink in printing 1. some % of the ink will be used for print head health 2. some will evaporate 3. some will be residual Lets guess,you waste 30% of the t..."
42032,2,"i spoke to flipkarts sales executive to know how much printout give by colour , B/W cartridge of PIXMA M2470 . he said around 160 by B/W and 160 by colour cartridges. i took only 98 printout by b/w cartridge and 87 by colour cartidge. printer PIXMA M2470 is average printer in that cost . FLIPKART executive bluffed me regarding this product ."
42033,1,"Worst Product I have ever crossed in my life.. You cannot refill your catridge, instead you should buy a New one that costs you 799 for Black and 1300 for Color.. Be aware of this Product..."
42034,1,"I ordered this printer on flipkart , but next day i get a sms that order is cancelled . who cancelled it ?

I need the same printer in same price . Horrible Horrible experience with flipkart . DO NOT BUY FORM FLIPKART THEY ARE FRAUD !!!"
42035,1,"it prints very slow, takes many pages at once and then there are paper jams, Quality of print is poor and misses out print, only able to print 35-40 pages.. Called flipkart but they refused to provide me any other printer.. After days of calling they agree to send me same make and model but haven't received it since 15 days, tired of calling again and again but no solution.. Bought HP 1510 from retail shop and that works fine. bad product and really poor service by flipkart."

42039,3,"it is curious to see the good speed of canon pixma with print , copy and scan. but one fault it makes is that it cannot reduce the ink consumption. it simply engulfs both black and coloured inks , but still it is best budget printer in flipkart till date...."
42040,1,"It is a worst product and deal which i don't suggest any one to buy.This deal absolutely fake and marketing attraction strategy was followed by the company.From the first cartridge, the no of copies which they promised was not fulfilled.Selling printer at the low price,and collecting the variable from selling cartridge."
42041,1,"Printed not more than 30-40 pages in black ink, and its cartridge was empty. takes a lot of time in printing/copying any document. makes odd sounds while printing. I suggest other buyers not to buy this model."
42042,5,"Hello friends product was very nice and low cast,Thanks to flipkart for providing such a good quality products with low price."
42043,5,"I'm very happy to this product,,thank u ws retail providing this item at very low cost....!!! many2 thanks for flipkart fast services.............................................................................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

When I contact with the costumer service, they asked me to order once more, and when I was doing that they increased the money by almost 400/- rupees. And the funniest think, they didnit even refunded my money yet !!_ SO GUYS BEWARE AND THINK BEFORE YOU DO SOMETHING !!! DON'T GET CHEATED !"
42052,1,I purchased this printer from Flipkart on BB day sale. When I received that I assembled it but it is always showing error. Yellow light keeps on blinking. When I asked for return WS Retail rejected return without any reason. Flipkart service is becoming poor now-a-days.

42088,1,"Never buy an inkjet printer for any purpose coss these printers could not be returned if u are not satisfied by it. Cartridge provided with the printer consist of low ink hp calling it as trial purpose ,after 2-3 fillings u have to buy new cartridge as it declared useless by the printer. Cartridges filling is not good idea in these printers as it wastes half of it's ink duing every cleaning. Buy inktank as they are too efficient"
42089,5,Excellent .. printer Hp desk jet 2331 . And you can must buy it üòâ.. i am really happy to my new printer..i think best low range best printer Hp .. Thanks and Thanks for Flipkart customer support ..
42090,3,Ink cartridge provided with it could not print even 60 black prints had to buy a refill ink .So if you have thought to buy remember to include the cost of the ink as well as the ink won't last long well the print quality is appreciable and good enough for home use .
42091,3,This product is good but the paper cost very high.. House Work is good but Business Work is Not Good..
42092,1,"Pathetic product, worst ever printing and scanning quality. Do not recommend this product to anyone, my 10 year old printer still works better with better quality output. Spend some extra money to get a better product else your money is wasted."
42093,5,"Extremely Good Product.The best print quality one can get. If you are on the track of purchasing it ,go ahead I can guarantee that you won't regret. A priceworthy and one of the best product by HP team to us .Thank You!!"
42094,5,Supob printer
42095,5,Superb product
42096,5,Very good nice printer
42097,4,Good product
42098,1,very bad product... it shows low ink after printing arounrd 50 pages and ink cartridge is very costly around 2000 rs and prints only 100 pages go and buy another printer
42099,3,After 40 to 50 prints the ink cartridge will be low . Per printout the estimate cost is 5 to 7 rupees . And to buy another cartridge it cost around 800 rupees. It is very expensive because the ink will use more for print. I am really disappointed about the ink cartridge. It doesn't fit for small business or student because its ink cartridge is expensive and hardly we can take around 40 to 50 printout..

42469,5,"- It is just a superb device in this price range. I am not sure why many have rated negative. - I am using this from past 1 month and there is no issue found. Print/Scan/Copy all are working excellent. - You will get a wide range of options as input while using the scanner. Also, the print quality is good. - It will be slow in printing as this is a DESKJET printer. This is normal. - If you want faster print you have to spend more for the laser printer. Spend money and get faster speed."

42808,3,The monitor is good. It come with the power connector which is used for high voltage items and it will not fit in a normal 3 pin plug. Yoh need a bigger plug which is used for AC for this cord. Have purchased another connector from market for it to fit in the standard extension cord.
42809,1,"Inferior product - one of the worst from Dell. Even a laptop screen second hand is better than this. Inferior quality LCD screen parts used. Display has round white marks within 10 days. Reducing clarity of display of numbers. Not recommended to use for work/business purposes.  Power plug send with this item is not of Indian standard. It is a very large power plug, send on purpose so that the return policy of 10 days will lapse."
42810,3,"Viewing Angle is just average; It's strange that the monitor requires 16A Socket, therefore doesn't fit in the normal socket; Not LED, the display is LCD, Title is misguiding the consumers; The package was already opened by the seller; Average HDMI cable, the display looks blurred using HDMI Cable; Made in China, the printed manufacturing date was Oct'20, can't speak about its reliability at this point; Other Points: Comes with HDMI Cable and VGA Cable for respective ports, along with 3.5mm A..."

42934,4,"Overall I am quite satisfied and happy with the monitor. The only reason I am give 4 star is due to the fact that the power cable that this monitor uses is a 16A one. This was a surprise as I did not expect a monitor to have a 16A input cable l. Had to buy a converter to get it working. This delayed the use by couple of days more. But other than that, this is a very good buy"

42984,3,"Product is good. It was available for Rs 500 less next day after ordering so felt cheated. Also beware it has 16A power cord (which is used for devices like Refrigerator, Washing machine) so it wont fit in your regular socket."
42985,1,The power plug/pin is too big.. does not fit anywhere. It's bigger than required for a refrigerator. Don't know why it requires so much power. ..The monitor is just okay but worth the price

43442,5,"It serves the purpose and it is beautiful. Let‚Äôs start the review with delivery. It was fast but the package box was a huge square shaped one with package inside. When I opened it and found the screen is beautiful and sleek. The packaging contained:- 1)vga cable 2) HDMI cable 3) stand for screen 4) screen 5) power cable 6) CD (I don‚Äôt know why I could not find CD drives on most of the latest laptops) So, it was easy to setup and I was able to do it in less than 5 mins. So here are some pros a..."
43443,5,"Before describing the monitor itself, I want to mention that I am extremely pleased by the seller and delivery. I ordered this on Saturday afternoon and I had it with me on Sunday afternoon. Fastest delivery that I've ever had.  The box comes with a HDMI and a VGA cable. The screen has a very basic I/O: Just one for VGA and HDMI each. No speakers on the monitor. The monitor stand is fixed, cannot be adjusted for height or swivel. That said, it looks very nice on my desk. The screen is very sl..."
43444,5,"Perfect aspect ratio , colours are good . Slim and sleek design . Best in this price range ."
43445,4,"Not five star because the response time is not suitable for gaming purposes therefore it is a general purpose monitor. Hope this helps. Brightness is good, and its a good one at this price specially impressed by the 3 year guarantee claim made by the dealer."
43446,5,Got this beauty at just 9300. A pretty good deal for a 24inch IPS monitor. Great color production and the looks pretty slick.
43447,5,"I've been using it since a year and here is my conclusion... the display is very good colours are accurate and the resolution is really full hd and it gives full screen experience, just the bezel at the bottom is a bit annoying. there are some difference in colours of monitor and smartphone or other device but I noticed it in every monitor. all and all it's a good product, you should try it out."
43448,5,Amazing Value For Money Monitor  I Use This Excellent Display 15 Days Amazing Response  (1) HDMI Cable (2) Amazing Screen (3) power Cable
43449,5,Awesome product. Nice display. Gives some flickering in screen if connected via VGA but crystal clear clarity if connected via HDMI. Worth buying and value for money.
43450,5,Proudly Saying take it as early as possible if you think to take any monitor....kindly go for it without any hesitation and too much thinking.... today it's arrived at my place and after installation really I just wondered to see bcz it's fully screen and when I started a video in YouTube with highest resolution I just wondered to see what Crystal clear picture I can't explain and when I start a high resolution game it's give me my dream picture of the characters and others features was tooo...
43451,5,"Do not think twice before purchasing it some will say lg display is good samsung is better, it has a response time of 7 ms which is slower than usual and u are here searching for an IPS panel monitor it clears that u want a good picture quality and video experience so go for it don't listen to any other if u take it then u will give a review here like me.."
43452,4,"It's a good product (only been 1 week though, will update later on). Looks good. Works well. Sleek, light weight.  Following are some nit-picking from the initial experience: Not easily accessible ports (These are behind screen; hidden).It could have been way better if these would have been on the side. The stand is good looking, but not practical. It's not height adjustable."
43453,5,"Awsome quality, best moniter in this price, perfect & true color for photo & video, best moniter for photoshop working & video editing.. Loved it.. Thanku flipkart.. Flipkart service is very good before time delivery i loved it."

The color scheme of silver and bezel less scheme make other monitors in 24 inch look ordinary. A 5 star from me."

43864,5,Nice product. Bluetooth connectivity are very good and long distance. This speaker is suitable for small rooms in very nice experience. In this price very best quality. Very small product but sounds unbelievable. Sound very clear and good. 1 sub woofer 15 w 4 satellite speakers √ó 10 w = 4 w So Total 55 w 4.1 HOME THEATRE SYSTEM
43865,4,"Writing this review after using 4 days.. No doubt its best sound system under this price segment. Let me tell u first, over all in this price segment this intex 4.1 channel home theater is super good. Really impressed with the sound üîä quality and Bass is very high. What more can u expect at this price. After all its brand intex. Over all you can buy this product with no doubt. You will get all necessary features.  CONNECTIVITY FEATURES ***  Bluetooth (10 m.

43866,4,Its good in this price range but if you are looking for a high definition sound clarity so this is not for you and as of its cost it is best as per my opinion. one thing more bluetooth range is only 5 to 6 mts so keep this in mind before choosing this.
43867,5,Completely mind blowing speaker more than my expectations and pocket friendly I'm very satisfied with the sound quality.... Very good all features work perfectly and fluent..!!
43868,5,Brilliant excellent performance thank you Flipkart I am use 10 days super product
43869,3,An average product which gives a decent output. Dont expect above average. As i also have a Intex 4.1 which is a old one bought before 10 years which is producing a good bass and sound output. But this product is just like a speaker box.. If u want a normal speaker with a minimal bass go for it. If u want a home theater effect dont go for it. While taking the price into consideration the speaker is good for the amount.
43870,5,"Ordered this and next day delivered (Rs.1699.00) Flipkart packaging is not good in this item only a poly pack but delivered without any damages and got recently manufactured product Oct/2020.  About this product: 1) Subwoofer Bass 5/5 2) Satellite speaker 3/5 Sound is good but it is mentioned 10 X 4 = 40 watt, it sounds like total output of about 10-15 watt only except subwoofer not because the speaker but inbuilt circuit board.

43871,3,"Good product valuable for money I like it, if u selecting for a better quality home theater under cheapest rate I preferd for u this b/s it's good and good quality one"
43872,4,Best buy in low budget. Sound quality is not that great however sound clarity is pretty good. I recommend to put some more money and get a good quality sound system if you are a music lover. It's good for people with low budget who are ok with so so sound system clarity. The material used is low quality so eventually you have to replace your system may be in a year or two. All functions mentions work perfectly fine. Good for your bedroom. Not recommended for living room.
43873,5,Nice product. Nice sound. The advantage is it have led light and 4 speaker

47727,1,"First of all I am not recommending to buy this item due to following reasons:  1) Even though it is having 4 antennas, the range, I mean the strength of the Wifi signal is very much less than that of Netgear / TP Link routers with single antenna.  2) Most of the tools or features in the MiWifi app are not working.  3) Connectivity details are in China Language as usual.  4) It is very difficult to search for a password. Since No where it is mentioned.  5) Very difficult to mount on the wall. ..."
47728,4,These Router is just awesome.. I have used Mi Router 3c and now i ordered this one 4c.. This one is just an upgrade to the other one. But it works fine.. Not a single.issue till now using 3c from about a year and 6 months.. Using thia one from past 3 days the speed is good as per my plan no problems with any connections.. Look is also good but the thing which stops me to buy is the Company which is basically a chinese brand.. This is my last thing which i will be purchasing that is made in ch...
47729,5,"Smart features,looks is also impressive and app optimization is so good I like the overall extraordinary product."
47730,5,Good value for money product  Range-good  Speed - If your connection below 100 mbps so that it's good for you. But if you have more than 100 mbps connection so better you choose a dual band(5ghz) router
47731,5,GOOD PRODUCT & SOME CONS  MIWIFI QUALITY IS SUPER SOLID PERFORMANCE IS ALSO BEST AT THIS PRICE SEGMENT ROUTER HAS NEW FEATURE CALLED SIGNAL WALL PENETRATE MODE ALSO YOU CAN WIFI CONTROL APP (MIWIFI) FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE BUT ONLY I HAVE ONE ISSUE [CHINESE PRODUCTS MOSTLY SPYING YOUR DATA SO MAYBE IT'S ALSO SPYING OR NOT ]
47732,3,"Just like a normal router, works well and as expected but nothing special.  It has those basic features as of all routes which includes :- 1. Bandwidth Control for some devices 2. Hiding the network SSID 3. Total data monitoring   However, even thought it as 4 antennas, the range is very low (I am not running it on 5 GHz otherwise it will be much lower). When I go onto rooftop (just above my room) the signal drops and only 1 bar of signal is available. Not to mention it only covers the place ..."
47733,1,Genuinely MI products are good and I am using all the products of Mi And I need to say about the MI router is after 2 weeks of usage is suddenly shut down and it is not even blinking the lights on top of Mi router I have seen a big issue with this MI router and I want to suggest you people to take the other best companies for your router I am saying genuinely to you all you have buying to take this product From Hyderabad Alwal
47734,5,Very good connectivity and range a bit less tried sign strength is good but if you go far about 10m it wouldn't give good signals. And app connectivity is easy to manage new and guest accounts. Overall a satisfied purchase from flipkart. And it's not a dual band wifi it's operates on 2.4 GHz band.
47735,5,It's really awesome products nice design with good inbuilt feature makes it a pro level WiFi router as I have at the moment 2 system working as we are working from home also 6 other mobiles are connected but I am getting a good speed to all the connections.
47736,5,Best router at this price range. It's very compact and lightweight. Though it's wi-fi range is not of some 4 antenna router still it's pretty good compared to other routers at this price range.
47737,2,The product is a really good product from Mi as it doesn't take much time to setup and minimum technical skill would be required to set this thing up...it is also easy to use by tha app and gives you full control over the device. A smart router in true sense.  Now after this why have I gave this 2 star...simple only one reason the packaging that I have got today and about this I won't write in details over here but rather I am sharing 2 photos which will be enough
47738,5,Best Router in this segment...Go for it üëç Better than other brands like TP Link or D-Link. This router has various features and attractive sleek design with matte looks which wins your heart at first look. And 4 high gain antennas are outstanding...It covers my 3 BHK easily. Easy to use and beat thing is that you can easily access this from your phone... loaded with features.  In layman language...This router easily sync with your day-to-day life.  Thanks.
47739,5,"most trusted band router with excellent product and work smoothly through MI WIFI app. thank flipkart and thank MI band ,nice looking and performing product ,I recommend all router user in INDIA to use mi router .Thank You."
47740,4,Nice Product........ It's an amazing product which is having 4 antennas for giving a wider range of connectivity.And it is an absolute SMART ROUTER which has the option of getting the details of all the connected devices.You can also set the daily data quota which will save your data if you are having a limited data plan from your ISP.  You can additionally connect up to 64 devices at a time without losing any speed.  The range is not so good as I have expected.... It is not giving an adequat...
47741,5,Wonderful purchase!!! üòÉüòÉ The best product at this price... There is no router at this price this good... Lookswise also very sleek and elegant ‚ù§‚ù§ very happy! Must buy!!! üíï
47742,5,"Using it as a range extender (wired) , woking like a charm for me, Myth about ping ,it depends on your location like if you live in metro cities your ping will be very low (because metero cities have Larger number of servers) but if you live in small cities or town (like me) no matter which connection you buy your ping will never match with metero cities( because firstly our city server send their data to these metro cities server) trust me I've have tried many FTTH connection and never get..."
47743,3,Range is not good else ok..its good only for 1 bhk but you have to place in center then u will get proper connectivity
47744,3,4 antennas do not actually make any difference in reality..router is good but quality of signal gets generated in not that strong...when it comes to penetrate 3 walls it failed to show the power..works better with mi devices like phones or laptop compares to others...does not have a signal quality selector like only n or b/g/n
47745,5,Its a superb router to have......but remember one thing dont purchase this router by looking into the 4 antennas...!! Its a router worthy of range what u get from 2 antennas only. Its a good router u have app support as well. Very good interface u can easily check if any unwanted one is using ur router. Good to have .....go for it .... Vfm (value for money) for sure ..!!
47746,5,"I am writing this review after one month of uses of the another great product from xiomi... First of all the interface of the app to access the router is very simple.. keep is mind if you need more than 2 lan port this product is surely not for you, otherwise blindly go for it... If you have big house like me then it is the best router you can get to cover all the rooms.."
47747,4,Great router. Just don't think that because of the 4 sticks it is gonna have exceptional range. Good product for its price.
47748,5,Love the product....not so good built quality ..but works very well and that too at very reasonable price
47749,5,Product was excellent the speed for. Playing youtube is awesome n we can connect upto 64 devices new device notification is also available n bandwidth speed is also set by ours
47750,5,"Using this as a Wireless Repeater. Working perfectly. No issues. Very few Setup steps, which is extremely helpful."
47751,5,Best
47752,5,"Edit: Problem solved after replacing the ISP modem provided by local ISP.  Old review:Have lots of features but there is no stability in the connection, but actual broadband connection is stable! Also wifi connects and disconnects frequently."
47753,1,I purchased this router to extend JIOFI range but JIOFY itself provides far better coverage than this router. There is no refund option so I think I wasted my hard earned money :(
47754,2,"It's just good for 1BHK flat, beyond that you get very poor range"
47755,5,nice
47756,4,Good
47757,5,Router is very good...and the delivery man is very fast nd niceüòä

47768,1,"Pls don't buy MI ROUTER. it's a very bad router. Maximum 10 miter are covered. It's very worst router. I thik TP link is much better. So, don't buy. After all it's have no refund policy. Only replacement policy."
47769,5,Nice product
47770,5,Excellent Router from Mi in this price point. I asked few broadband technician about the product they said perfect router for home to office work.
47771,1,Worest router it's range is upto a single bedroom my Digisol single antena router is better than this one.Dont waste your money i returned it and return policy also very tough very very low range i think it is waste to have 4 antena single antena router is best than this one..
47772,3,Good Router having rich user interface alongwith mobile application. But does not meet my expectations. Some drawbacks are:-- 1. Range is not good in coparision to Dlink DIR-615 2. Does not assign static IP to router in Reapeater Mode(Wired or wireless)
47773,4,"Range is poor, rest everything is fantastic! I keep almost 8-9 device connected and all work flawless.  Since the range is less, keep it somewhere where it can send signals throughout the flat.  Hardware needs improvement, Software is best that nobody else gives."
47774,1,Pathetic product.. totally waste of money
47775,5,Supperb
47776,1,"It's bad. It don't give range. My friend and me took it 2 router together. Both router are bad. We have a plan of 5mbps, but it give20 kbps speed. West of money"

Router Gets disconnected From internet very often for about 30-40 sec and again start working , i never faced this issue with my tp link router.. despite having 4 antenna range covarage is very poor my old Router was better .. guys just buy any dlink or tp-link Router .."

47785,3,"I am using this as a repeater.. pros: 1. smart looks 2.easy configuration 3. wifi range is good but had more expectation as it has 4 antennas. Cons: 1.sometimes too much packet loss 20% to 50%.Then it become very irritating while online gaming. 2.features are limited in repeater mode. 3.speed decreases up to 30% 4.It has a heating issue,but acceptable. 5.hardware is not the best  With a little more money you can get a better router of dilnk or tplink..."

Pros The device looks sleep and can be kept in any room without spoiling the look of the room. Easy to set up and connect The interface is awesome and can be easily used.  Cons Even with 4 antennas the range is bad."

47848,4,Nice product
47849,5,Best router in this budget segment.... Really awesome product. I love it so much
47850,2,Used this for almost a month. If you are spending 1K to get this. Would recommend to get a DLink for 1.5k. Because this MI router will give you high ping. Low wifi coverage. The connection will break if you are in a different room. In case you have a old build property then the scenerio would get even worse.
47851,5,Very good product no issue of coverage i don't know why everyone is complaining about the range i live on 3rd floor and the network reaches the ground floor too . Very satisfied
47852,5,Good on this price range.
47853,5,Router is exceptional.. Every one complaining about range but it is working gem for me as it is covering entire my house with full signal and even down floor with 3points.... Thank you flipkart for speedy delivery and delivering me orginal product
47854,5,Good product fot that price i liked it buy it guys.
47855,3,Ok ok product.. Range is not what i expected.. 4 antennas are just for the showcase nothing else.

47917,5,Nice product
47918,2,Range is very poor can't even cover a single story building. and is slower than the other counterparts. I would suggest to buy TP link.
47919,4,Beat
47920,5,The monitoring features is very good in MI router.
47921,5,Mi router 4C is the best wifi extender I have ever used. The best part is you can control all its features via Mi wifi app which is very easy to use. The network coverage is also very very good and this very easy to install and configure. I just want to mention one thing that I was little disappointed by the packaging flipkart provided. The router was not even wrapped in paper. The original packaging was also damaged because it was not wrapped.
47922,1,Too tough to connect with the app. Each and every time it shows error. :-(

47940,5,Ces we use it for windows laptops
47941,1,"First time when connected, the RJ45 connector not inserted in the WAN port of the router, due to which no internet, After cutting and pressing the connector then with great difficulty it went in side the WAN port. Very poor router built quality Nothing great about the speed, I have 200Mbps plan and I get only 40Mbps from router"
47942,2,Very basic 2.4 Ghz Wifi Router . Easy to set up and use but Drops Internet once in a while and then gets connected by itself . OK for the price but better if you upgrade to a more stable dual band router
47943,4,"Nice bt some problem I face to configure,,,bt nice"
47944,5,Over all good.... But i mention that the of this router is not as expected... The four antennas are just show off i think.... Considering this the router is good... You can buy it... Over all decent product... Does the job

47950,5,"Good product. Don't have any complaints. Easy to configure Flipkart delivered very quickly, thanks for it..."
47951,3,Good for 1BHK apartment. Would not recommend for anything larger than that. Don't fall for those 4 antennas! App is user friendly. It provides features like bandwidth control for individual devices which comes in handy if you have a limited plan. If not for the area coverage its good in this budget.
47952,2,After 1 year problem occurs I was using this as a repeater my other wifi tht I am using since 4 year speed is awesome however as a repeater net speed is very bad.... In the beginning it was awesome...
47953,5,"Super product. I ordered pn 26th June 2021 and got delivered on 27th June 2021.  Good product, covers all over the house, can be used as a router or as a wifi extender."

47971,5,I purchased this Mi router from flipkart after one of my cousin recommended me this. After installing this in my living room the wifi coverage problem is totally solved and the best part is that you can control all its features via Mi wifi app. Xiaomi as always is providing best value for money products in every category.

48269,5,Thanks to flip kart and ekart
48270,5,It's a good product from xiaomi. AboutAbout 30 metre range I'm impressed
48271,2,The product is extremely difficult to mount. As it can only be placed on a table. Signal strength won't be good enough if you expect signals in one room with the router in another. Don't go for it.
48272,3,Signal strength is so weak .
48273,5,Good üëç ü•∞300mps speed

48285,5,Good one
48286,3,Power adapter not working after 1 month of use.

48475,1,Worst Item Dont Purchase Signal Strength Weak UI Management so difficult Many Reasons found to say
48476,1,No signal strength.. worst performance.. money waste
48477,5,Good
48478,4,Good
48479,2,Worst range
48480,2,Poor range.
48481,3,It's range is not good.
48482,4,Easy to configure and good coverage for a small house.  Compare to other devices it gave me hassle free configuration and moreover it's easy to install. Also the wire connector is big enough to keep distance.  However if you are looking for high speed more then 100mbps and bigger house then this would not fullfil your requirements.
48483,1,Wi-Fi low range
48484,4,NB :. It is a router not a modem.. It is only used to extend the connection and increase the coverage and speed  Don't underestimate it is the only thing needed for a broadband connection . A modem is also needed.
48485,2,The range is not working at all. Even doesn't reach ground floor from first floor.
48486,1,Don't purchase. Wifi range is too bad. After 6 month . Wifi Problems start . Download speed 400kbps on wifi. I have 100mbps plan on Airtel fiber .
48487,3,I'm using it as a wifi extender.. It serves the purpose

48552,3,Very nice product but the frequency of the router is decreasing day by day
48553,1,network not proper
48554,3,im not recommded this router for more than 1000sqft area.signal strength is average.you can increase signal strenth by applying silver foil.miwifi app is really excellent. it can fully access to all devices connected to your wifi you can also set speed limit for specific devices.
48555,5,Nice
48556,5,Best in class
48557,5,Thanks üòä
48558,5,Awasome
48559,5,Super
48560,4,Awesome
48561,3,"For Home use its okk..But if u r thinking for office use plz go for another product..response time is very slow, by the way looks and design is good.. overall average product"
48562,4,Good
48563,4,Great product but there is no wps button and there is not hole so that we can hang it to the wall for this reason i have given it four star ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê other than that no problem
48564,5,Easy to Install and Faster Download
48565,3,Range is low
48566,4,Nice
48567,5,Good
48568,1,"Useless product, not working properly, not giving full signal in 3 meter range."
48569,5,nice
48570,5,Good product
48571,1,Raise your money üí∞ so bad
48572,5,Nice product
48573,2,Very bad range. Four antenna attracts to purchase at that price. But performance is not even equal to some other two antenna router's. I regret this purchase üòè
48574,1,Ping is very worst
48575,1,Very very bad . don't by this router
48576,4,The Product Received on time and it was very good It was the value for money...!!
48577,2,Poor range Speed is also average. Go for some other options like tenda or D-Link
48578,4,Very good product. Working so fast.
48579,5,Good in signal üì∂strength
48580,5,Nice üëç product
48581,1,That product is very bad connectivity is very poor I am not recommended to buy . product only 10 days is not working .my rating is zero
48582,1,Faltu product
48583,3,Looks wise it's quite good. But the main reason for which anyone would buy this i.e. using the wifi the experience is not so good. Despite of having four antennas I'm not sure why it's range is not so good. It should be okay for two rooms. But beyond that one should not consider this.
48584,5,Very good product
48585,5,BEST IN CLASS.....................!
48586,5,It's very Nice and very Good Connectivity
48587,4,"average coverage,network speed distribution is awesome.....Thats all.."
48588,1,Range problem
48589,1,Poor signal quality
48590,4,I can give 4 star coz rage very good compared to D-Link. If u all have 2 BHK then this is very good for coverage even in washroom... Build is ok ok.. And very slim looks suprb Con:- Wire is too short... Two lane port
48591,1,Wrost router I have ever used. 50 Mbps connection but speed from router doesn't go beyond 10 Mbps. I suggest you all to do not buy this. It will waste your money. Even the response of company is also very very bad.
48592,1,Range gets dropping down in every month I'm using 100mps speed this router is not proving the range on this Totally un satisfied with the product...
48593,2,Range of 4 antena is too low as 1antenaüôÑ
48594,5,I can believe on mi after closing eyes.really it is nice product..
48595,5,Good
48596,3,Range is not up to the mark As accepted
48597,5,Very good
48598,5,Nice product
48599,3,Range is not as expected Only 15 meters range *in home I think this 4 antenna is not performing only one is active
48600,3,"I expect more range... But it provides almost every same range like tp-link, D-Link as this price range, otherwise it's a Good option.."
48601,5,Nice
48602,1,Wi-Fi Connecting problem auto Disconnecting and connect again after 2 min. I'm return this product.
48603,5,One of the best wifi router at affordable price

48608,5,Good
48609,3,Good product
48610,5,The best router in this price range. This is my second purchase and this time it is being used as a repeater. The setup is very simple and intuitive. Only thing I hope is addition of 5Ghz in the next upgrade at this price point.
48611,1,It's is very bad product not working properly
48612,5,Excellent
48613,1,worst product
48614,5,Amazing product..‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
48615,5,Awesome product in price..
48616,3,Good ‚ò∫Ô∏è c
48617,5,It's a nice product.
48618,5,I've been using it for 1 month. Best product in market. *value for price *good range *more than enough speed(after using it as a secondary router too) *the web portal is very much user friendly. *one tap convert... (as a router or repeater(wireless and wired) through the mobile app).  ** the mobile app actually does nothing but starts the connectivity.  After all.. You can buy the product if you get it under 1k.
48619,2,Network coverage is too bad.
48620,1,Terrible purchase Used 1day but wifi range is horrible even speed is too not good. 4 antenas not working and covering i think
48621,4,Bohut acha hai nice warking ü§óü§óü§óü§ó
48622,5,The Best
48623,1,It didn't work only when tried before installation ....
48624,1,"Worst product. Mi router 3C was much better than this. Range of this router is not good when compared to the Mi 3C router. Mi 3C router has the advantage of running on powerbank but not 4C. If you are looking for good range, this one is not for you. Go for Tenda N301 or TP-Link 841N if your budget is around thousand rupees."
48625,5,Very easy to configure. Nice speed. Nice looking device from MI. Thanks Flipkart for awesome delivery experience
48626,1,Very poor poor range even my house is small but range doesn't cross even 10ft üò°üò°i used only 1 day
48627,1,Previously i was using mi router 3c it has good coverage This 4c model doesn't give even half of the strength of old router Really disappointing worse than mobile hotspot
48628,4,I like it but only two lan port
48629,3,An average router. Don't buy it if you are looking for high range.
48630,5,It's perfectly worked üòÑ

48651,1,Range not properly my flat 2bhk didn't network issue
48652,5,Pole item super net
48653,5,I love this product.. product price is very good as compared to other router.. but one demerit i have notice that tha range of MI router is too short.. overall product is very good .. but range of a router is not suitable for long distance around 450sq.ft.
48654,1,It is a damaged product
48655,5,The shipment was nice
48656,4,"4 antenna is just overkill, it isn't any better than tp link or D-Link 2 antenna models. The best part of this router is its software. Very useful and use to use."
48657,5,Super router very easy setup n good speed
48658,5,Mesmerizing.
48659,5,good product
48660,5,All good but range is low
48661,4,"Good product, I am using it as repeater for enhancing the existing wifi signals into the non covered area of my house. Good product. Very simple to setup through its mi wifi app."
48662,4,I thought my girlfriend is the best thing but this wifi proved me wrong
48663,2,Coverage is very bad... those 4 anntenas of no useüëéüèº
48664,5,Value for money
48665,4,Good speed. Narrow range.
48666,3,Too good. But its china product.
48667,2,The range of the WiFi is not at all good. If you want to use it in 2 small rooms nearby then only it's good. Else go for something else.
48668,2,Don't buy this speed and range not good.Buy more trusted brands like Tplink and D-Link.My D-Link router covers almost half of home but this router can't even a single room.
48669,5,Good Product

48692,5,Vvv good
48693,5,Awesome product it's working absolutely fine
48694,5,Nice flipkart
48695,4,"Light weight. No hook holes to hang. Four antennas are good. Minimal design. One main Lan port, two child Lan ports."
48696,1,Worst product ever
48697,5,Delivery man was too awesome üëçüëèüëèüëè thanks flipkart
48698,2,Not good range sometimes disconnect network
48699,3,"Good at this price range, single band(2.4 gHz).The router has 4 antenna, but they are for showing, range is good for small room. I even can't get signal at ground floor, my router is placed at 1st floor. Good for this price point."
48700,1,I bought this router last week firstly I felt that some technical issues should happened but after 1week also same problem happened with me again and again don‚Äôt buy this it won‚Äôt cover a single floor also very bad coverage.
48701,1,Very poor signal range.
48702,1,Very bad router .
48703,5,Best quality nice to work
48704,5,Best product
48705,4,"Hanged at a place were it can reach my complete home, product is very light and powerful and easy to install. We can control it by using Mi WiFi app"
48706,5,Good Product
48707,4,Thanks filpkart
48708,1,Very poor range. Highly disappointed with the performance. I was using tenda and d-link routers(both having single antenna) before opting for this router. I was expecting a big boost on the range but after using it i am shocked to see the poor reception. I‚Äôll strictly not recommend this router to anyone mainly cos of its poor range
48709,3,Very low coverage. Better to go for TP link
48710,5,Ruff tum all jaan
48711,5,"Best router ,,, amazing experience with mi . It covers my all rooms and speed is superb and through mi wifi app its super duper cool and easy to connect ..‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüëç"
48712,3,Overall an average Router! Good point: Very light weight Very nice design Easy to setup and manage through mobile app. Can be used as repeater.  Cons: Range is average even though it has 4 antennas. Less than my current router with 2 antennas. Have only 2 lan ports. Dont have a hole for hanging on wall. So you have to keep it on some surface.  More ports and a modem port for telephone line would have been added advantage but modem does not have it.  Overall a good average router. I use it as...
48713,5,This is very good quality product and my work is very well
48714,5,Excellent stability Excellent strength Low range coverage
48715,3,Good
48716,4,After usage of 4months. Its really nice product.
48717,3,"Good in terms of speed and fast connectivity, however the range is soo poor that am unable to connect it beyond 15 meters on any side even after making sure there are no signal interferences"
48718,5,Awesome
48719,4,Wi-Fi range is not satisfactory..
48720,5,Nice product. I have installed on ground floor and access internet on first floor as well.
48721,5,"Doesn't give much range, but good enough within a small range"
48722,4,It's good for home daily use.Easy to setup with a little tutorial.But if you have plans to connect your house having too many walls and obstructions it can be a little let down at the furthest point.Still the connectivity received is appreciable.Given the price point in which you get its more than your expectations.The app led monitoring feature is a real delight.
48723,1,The connectivity is not even there from 10metres of router whenever there is a power off the router doesn't connect with the internet it is not working properly can't even switch off the router
48724,5,Very Good Quality
48725,5,Very nice router. Worth buying it.
48726,4,"Heavy duty router , best of all 1 k range , performance peaks and lets see for how many months it will last"
48727,4,"Timely delivery. The product works good so far but it would be too early to say anything. I have a problem with the seller, as the product was sent without external packing. When I received parcel, the original box was wet and Mishandled."
48728,5,A smart product
48729,5,It is average
48730,1,Disgusting every time Wi-Fi was disconnecting and also Wi-Fi range was not good if range is below 3 nothing can work

48763,5,Good
48764,5,Range is good User interface is very good compared to other companies

48862,3,"Overall the setting up of router is quite simple but if your broadband connection is giving 100mbps of speed through lan cable, than the router gives out only 50% of speed (i.e. 45 to 50mbps). Would expect xiaomi to look into this issue."
48863,5,Single band router good for home WiFi use. Range of 30 meter radius approx. No lagging and easy to configure. Thanks to Flipkart for timely delivery.

49282,3,Not as expected. Area coverage is less even it comes with 4 antenas
49283,5,This is a great product to work with i love MI
49284,4,"Initial impressions are good though the range/coverage you get is same as your ISP router. Wireless repeater performance is doing well as far as I observed.  MOBILE Application MI Wifi is having some little bug when changing network mode from wireless to wired repeater mode and next time when you trying to change the same, having difficulty on pairing your router and is not automatically detecting the same. Now you require to reset the router during that time."

50058,5,Best product
50059,4,"Easy to install,good range ,getting speed upto 10mbps according to my net plan."
50060,4,As of now router is working fine but some time there is connectivity issue i guess it was due to local provider end.
50061,3,Easy to use
50062,2,There is a significant drop in the signal strength. A 30mbps connection gives only 5-8mbps throught this router but over 30mbps over Lan cable. The signal strength also drops after 5-8ft making it useless even for a 2bhk.

50074,5,Thank you Flipkart and seller for this very good budget router. Delivery was on time before one day of they have mentioned.  Full star for the product but packaging was poor. It came with only its original box. It should have protective cover or a protective box.  I like this product for It's very easy setup method. It auto detects our internet broadband connection type and recommend us with right type. (Correct type of broadband connection).  It has not Switch for on/off.  It doesn't suppor...

50104,1,Very poor product
50105,4,Good product
50106,4,Good wifi range
50107,4,It's Made In China. Otherwise it is great router with minimalist interface and range is good according to 2 antennas it will be worth it. You will face no loss till 5m after that it deteriorates and last you can get range upto 15-20 m radius that will be enough. Using it in the centre point of your house and you are good to go. Well I used it as a repeater it is extending main wifi's signal fully.  2.4GHz is the only mode for repeater too. Those who don't know Don't think that you will repeat...
50108,3,Ok working but signal not proper
50109,5,Worthy product
50110,5,Super. Excellent wifi distribution. Very easy installation.
50111,5,Good one
50112,4,"After using almost 5 month I can say it one of the best router available .. It can penetrate 3 wall which is 5 inch , 10 inch , and 5 inch of thickness respectively with 40% signal strength .. and free space range is almost 50meter with 50% signal strength. If you place the router center of your house it can cover easily a 3bhk flat easily and can provide signal in 2 floor without any fluctuations.. In short just buy it..."
50113,1,worst router please don't buy all reviews are fake for extending warranty
